0062294776	description	A young woman must come to terms with the secret horror in her past to find love and happiness in this predictable new adult romance by the pseudonymous Lynn (Obsession author Jennifer L. Armentrout). After five hellish years of being called a lying whore in her small Texas town, 19-year-old Avery Morgansten is more than happy to leave for college in West Virginia. There she meets gorgeous, blue-eyed Cameron Hamilton, a fellow student who seems as attracted to her as she is to him. Haunted by her traumatic past, Avery is torn between protecting herself and finding love. The path to romance is long and rocky, and Cam has dark secrets of his own, but eventually both lovers come clean and all loose ends are neatly wrapped up. While Lynn's peripheral characters are fairly one-dimensional, Avery and Cam are compelling. Fans of stories about characters healed by love will find this one moderately satisfying.

042526596X	title	Gabriel's Inferno
042526596X	description	Sylvain Reynard is a Canadian writer with an interest in Renaissance art and culture and an inordinate attachment to the city of Florence. (Parenthetically, it should be noted that the snarky narrator of Gabriel’s Inferno was contracted to write this biographical description, and he can attest that SR is, in fact, real, and has an enviable collection of argyle socks.)
042526596X	description	 
042526596X	description	Chapter 1
042526596X	description	“...Miss Mitchell?”
042526596X	description	Professor Gabriel Emerson’s voice carried across the seminar room to the attractive brown-eyed young woman who was seated at the back. Lost in thought, or lost in translation, her head was down as she scribbled furiously in her notebook.
042526596X	description	Ten pairs of eyes swung to her, to her pale face and long lashes, her thin white fingers clutching a pen. Then ten pairs of eyes swung back to the professor, who stood perfectly still and began to scowl. His scathing demeanor contrasted sharply with the overall symmetry of his features, his large, expressive eyes, and full mouth. He was ruggedly handsome, but in that moment bitterly severe, which rather ruined the overall pleasing effect of his appearance.
042526596X	description	“Ahem.” A modest cough to her right caught the woman’s attention. She glanced in surprise at the broad-shouldered man sitting next to her. He smiled and flicked his eyes to the front of the room, back to the professor.
042526596X	description	She followed his gaze slowly, looking up into a pair of angry, peering blue eyes. She swallowed noisily.
042526596X	description	“I expect an answer to my question, Miss Mitchell. If you’d care to join us.” His voice was glacial, like his eyes.
042526596X	description	The other graduate students shifted in their seats and stole furtive glances at one another. Their expressions said what crawled up his ass? But they said nothing. (For it is commonly known that graduate students are loath to confront their professors with respect to anything, let alone rude behavior.)
042526596X	description	The young woman opened her mouth minutely and closed it, staring into those unblinking blue eyes, her own eyes wide like a frightened rabbit.
042526596X	description	“Is English your first language?” he mocked her.
042526596X	description	A raven-haired woman seated at his right hand tried to stifle a laugh, smothering it into an unconvincing cough. All eyes shifted back to the frightened rabbit, whose skin exploded into crimson as she ducked her head, finally escaping the professor’s gaze.
042526596X	description	“Since Miss Mitchell seems to be carrying on a parallel seminar in a different language, perhaps someone else would be kind enough to answer my question?”
042526596X	description	The beauty to his right was only too eager. She turned to face him and beamed as she answered his question in great detail, making a show of herself by gesturing with her hands as she quoted Dante in his original Italian. When she had finished, she smiled acidly at the back of the room, then proceeded to gaze up at the professor and sigh. All that was lacking from her display was a quick leap to the floor and a rubbing of her back on his leg to show that she would be his pet forever. (Not that he would have appreciated the gesture.)
042526596X	description	The professor frowned almost imperceptibly at no one in particular and turned his back to write on the board. The frightened rabbit blinked back tears as she continued scribbling, but mercifully she did not cry.
042526596X	description	A few minutes later, as the professor droned on and on about the conflict between the Guelfs and the Ghibellines, a small square of folded paper appeared on top of the frightened rabbit’s Italian dictionary. At first she didn’t notice it, but once again, a soft ahem drew her attention to the good-looking man beside her. He smiled more widely this time, almost eagerly, and glanced down at the paper.
042526596X	description	She saw it and blinked. Carefully watching the back of the professor as he drew endless circles around endless Italian words, she brought the paper to her lap where she quietly unfolded it.
042526596X	description	Emerson is an ass.
042526596X	description	No one would have noticed because no one was looking at her, except for the man at her side. As soon as she read those words, a different kind of flush appeared on her face, two pink clouds on the curve of her cheeks, and she smiled. Not enough to show teeth or what could be dimples or a laugh line or two, but a smile nonetheless.
042526596X	description	She raised her large eyes to the man next to her and looked at him shyly. A wide, friendly grin spread across his face.
042526596X	description	“Something funny, Miss Mitchell?”
042526596X	description	Her brown eyes dilated in terror. Her new friend’s smile quickly disappeared as he turned to look at the professor.
042526596X	description	She knew better now than to look up at the professor’s cold blue eyes. Instead, she put her head down and worried her plump lower lip between her teeth, back and forth and back and forth.
042526596X	description	“It was my fault, Professor. I was just asking what page we were on,” the friendly man interceded on her behalf.
042526596X	description	“Hardly an appropriate question from a doctoral student, Paul. But since you asked, we began with the first canto. I trust you can find it without Miss Mitchell’s help. Oh, and Miss Mitchell?”
042526596X	description	The frightened rabbit’s pony tail trembled ever so slightly as she lifted her gaze.
042526596X	description	“See me in my office after class.”

0425280624	description	FIVE YEARS AGO
0425280624	description	PUCK
0425280624	description	Motherfucker that burned.
0425280624	description	The shot was a double, and the fact that itd come cradled between two beautiful, giant tits attached to a stripper with endless legs and a tight ass didnt hurt one goddamned bit. Tequila hit my stomach, the alcohol shocking my system, and shit finally got real.
0425280624	description	Freedom.
0425280624	description	Fourteen months since the last time Id had a decent drinkall but forgotten what it felt like, too. That sweet, harsh pain that comes from losing the surface layer of skin all the way down your throat? Gorgeous. Never felt better in my life, and thats a fact. Helped that the queen of body shots had sucked me off right after wed pulled up to the party.
0425280624	description	Spent the last year trying to decide what Id do first when I finally got out. Kept going back and forth between getting laid and getting drunk, but God apparently has a soft spot for assholes because wed found one hell of a good compromise.
0425280624	description	Id been free nearly four hours now. Still felt like a dream. The California Department of Corrections took its own sweet time with everything, up to and including processing a man out. Id spent half the wait wondering if the cockwads would change their minds or if the club lawyer had forgotten something. Figured theyd find some way to fuck with my head.
0425280624	description	FBI, state cops, even Homeland Securitythey all wanted a piece of my club, the Silver Bastards MC, and not a week went by inside that they didnt try to cut it out of my hide. Guess they figured a prospect made an easy target.
0425280624	description	Not fucking likely.
0425280624	description	My old man died for the Bastards. If I turned, hed haunt my ass the rest of my life because that shit does not stand in my family. Id been born to wear a Bastard cut. And tonight? For the first time I finally had the right to show those colors off.
0425280624	description	A hand slapped my shoulder, then a burly man caught me up in a hug so tight it hurt. My fucking ribs creaked.
0425280624	description	That patch feel right on your back, brother? asked Boonie. He was the president of the Silver Bastards in Callup, Idaho, and Id heard him call me a hell of a lot of thingsbut never brother. Felt good. Damned good. Until an hour ago, Id been a prospect and Id never gotten any special treatment because of my old man. Thats how I wanted it.
0425280624	description	Best night of my life, I admitted. He pulled back, and his face grew serious.
0425280624	description	Proud of you, he said. You did what you had to. Protected the club, took care of business. Painter told us how things were inside, how you took his back. You earned this, earned it with your life and your blood. I know you wont shame this patch, Puck.
0425280624	description	I wont, I replied, his words almost too much. Boonie grinned suddenly, then grabbed my arm and turned me toward the bar again.
0425280624	description	Drink up, he told me. Then find yourself some pretty little thing to play with, because tomorrow were ridin home. Your bikes in good shapetook care of it for you.
0425280624	description	Thanks.
0425280624	description	Another shot, baby? the stripper asked. She rolled onto her side, reaching out to catch my neck with her hand, pulling me in for a kiss. That brought me a little too close to her face. She was sweaty, and her mascara had started running. Didnt smell that great, either.
0425280624	description	More shots, I said, pulling away. Id appreciated the blow job, no question. But she wasnt exactly the fantasy Id been jacking off to the last year and Id promised myself I wouldnt settle once I got out. I wanted someone freshsomeone clean and soft and sweet enough to eat. Id play with her for a while before letting myself go, punching through all that softness until she screamed and begged for mercy.
0425280624	description	Mouth, cunt, ass.
0425280624	description	Thatd been what got me through those long nights wondering why the fuck Id let myself get caught.
0425280624	description	Ignoring the bitch on the bar, I reached across and grabbed the bottle of tequila, chugging nearly a third of it down. Christ, there went the rest of my throat. Then I turned to look out across the room. Four of my new Silver Bastard brothers had come down from CallupBoonie, Miner, Deep, and Demon. Joining them were four Reapers and two Reaper prospects. They were here to welcome Painter, whod gone down with me on a weapons charge. This sucked, but such is life. Wed been fighting for our clubs, so no regrets there. Through a combination of luck and well-placed payoffs, wed managed to stick together for the duration of our time served. The clubs provided the funds and the attorneysto protect them, we matched that investment with our silence.
0425280624	description	Painter caught my eye from across the room, grinning. After so much time together I could almost read his thoughts. I gave him a nod, one of those chin jerks that speaks volumes.
0425280624	description	Congrats to you, too, asshole.
0425280624	description	You havin fun? a man asked. I looked down to find a painfully skinny, greasy little man missing half his teeth standing next to me. Tweaker called Teeny. His face was just a little too eager, his eyes a little too bright. Unfortunately, Teeny was our host for the night so I had to be nice to him. We were out in the middle of nowhere, tucked back in a canyon where this douche had somehow acquired a house. The Longnecks MCone of our allies, although their loyalty was questionablehad a warehouse set up in a shop right next to this guys house.
0425280624	description	This Teeny asshole wasnt even part of the club... apparently his brother Bax was patched in, though, so they used him as a pit stop. Something didnt quite add up about the situation, but fuck if I cared. In the morning Id be riding for home. With luck my future association with the state of California in general and Teeny in particular would be extremely limited.
0425280624	description	See anything you like? he asked. Thats my old lady, there. You want her? Shes real good, welcome you home right.
0425280624	description	I shrugged, glancing over toward his woman. She was probably in her midthirties, I decided. Pretty enough, but she had a hard, tired look around her eyes that didnt appeal. Not only that, she was wiry and skinny as fuck. Probably smoking meth to block out the fact that she had to live with this dickwad.
0425280624	description	No, shes great but not my type, I said, casually taking another drink of tequila. Wasnt burning so much now, which in retrospect shouldve been a sign to slow down. Maybe things wouldve turned out different.
0425280624	description	Shitty thing about timeonly runs the one direction.
0425280624	description	Whats your type? he asked. I shrugged. The day I needed some tweaker to find me pussy, Id cut off my own cock and get it over with. Swallowing another drink, I glanced across the room, pointedly ignoring him.
0425280624	description	Thats when I saw her.
0425280624	description	Now, I fuckin hate clichs, and shit like this only happens in movies... but I swear to fuck, I think I fell for her in that instant. She was small, with long brown hair in one of those knot things on top of her head. Not dressed to show off her figure, either. I could still see she had a tiny waist, though, along with generous tits and the kind of round, healthy curves you just know will cradle your hips perfectly when youre pounding her.
0425280624	description	I had to have her.
0425280624	description	Like, needed her. Now.
0425280624	description	Good call, Teeny said. I ignored him, focusing on the angel I had every intention of owning just as soon as I talked her out of her pants. God, she was pretty. Kind of out of place, too. Not flirting with anyone, and not a ton of makeup. Just wandering around, picking up empties, and avoiding conversation. Fascinating.
0425280624	description	Ill introduce you.
0425280624	description	Teeny walked across the room toward my Dream Fuck. I started after him, because I didnt want the asshole speaking on my behalf. Then Boonie caught my arm.
0425280624	description	Heads-up, he said, his voice pitched low, difficult to hear through the noise of the party. We think somethins going on with that guy. Dont be afraid to talk him up, okay? Can always use good information.
0425280624	description	I nodded, wondering why the fuck Teeny had to pick me to buddy up with. Tonight was for relaxing, enjoying myself. Just looking at him made me feel dirty, and considering some of the shit Ive pulled in my life, thats an accomplishment. Another hand slapped my back, then Painter caught me by the neck, squeezing me as he laughed.
0425280624	description	Never ends, he said. Boonie cock-blocking you?
0425280624	description	I punched him in the gutnot hard. Just enough to make him back off.
0425280624	description	No, right now you have that honor, I muttered, glaring at him. Christ, we just spent a year together in a fuckin cell. Think weve covered everything, so let me get laid? Please?
0425280624	description	He answered by punching me back, and I reeled... damn, hadnt realized how drunk Id gotten. Still, I wasnt about to go down easy. I swayed, watching him as our brothers started crowding around us. The wild gleam in his eyesa mixture of almost manic happiness and pent-up energymatched my own.
0425280624	description	Take it outside, Boonie said. I got fifty on Puck.
0425280624	description	Hundred on Painter, Picnic Hayes, the Reapers president, answered and then we were bundled outside for the fight.
0425280624	description	I couldnt wait.
0425280624	description	Wed sparred before, of course. Nothing but time to kill in the pen, so I knew Painters moves like they were my ownand he knew mine, too. We were a good match, could go either way. Neither of us had much in the way of formal training but wed both picked up a fair amount along the way. Hell, Id gotten caught in my first bar fight when I was fourteen years old, seeing as my pop wasnt exactly Father of the Year material. Still loved the old bastard, though.
0425280624	description	The sun was fading as we stepped outside, painting the sky in pinks and oranges shot through with smudged clouds. I paused a moment, struck by the incredible beauty all around me, and smiled, breathing deep. So fucking good to be outside again. Nobody knows what its like, trapped in a cell like an animal. Nobody but the guys whove heard the sound of those gates closing behind them.
0425280624	description	Fortunately for me, I wasnt exactly the first Silver Bastard to do time for the club, which meant my brothers got me. They knew what this was like.
0425280624	description	Okay, we got a circle here, Pic was saying. I blinked, starting to process the fact that maybe boxing with Painter while I was drunk might not be such a hot idea. Of course, he was drunk, too, and the booze would numb the pain... Fight goes until one of you is down or taps out. Time to make your bets, brothers.
0425280624	description	Boonie caught my arm, pulling me to the side and looking into my face.
0425280624	description	You ready? he asked. I nodded sharply, because drunk or not, I wasnt going to pussy out in front of my president on the same day I got my colors. I glanced across the dusty circle to see Painter, who gave me a friendly sneer. Laughing, I flipped him off, then shook my arms out, loosening up.
0425280624	description	Thats when I saw her again. Off to the side, standing next to Teeny, who was talking rapidly and pointing to me. I frowned, because I really didnt need or want that asshole on my side. Knowing my luck, the fucker would send her running. I nudged my brother, Deep, who was standing next to me.
0425280624	description	See that girl? I asked, jerking my chin toward her. Make sure Teeny doesnt scare her off, okay?
0425280624	description	Sure, he said. Ill keep an eye out.
0425280624	description	Thanks.
0425280624	description	Painter and I stepped into the circle together, and I felt the thrill of adrenaline cut through the haze of alcohol. My blood started pumping, pounding through me until I could all but taste it. Christ, but I loved to fight. Always seemed to clear my head, and Id gotten good enough over the years that I won more than I lost. Inside, those skills had saved our asses, and Id picked up my fair share of pointers from the very man I found myself facing.
0425280624	description	Painter moved first, coming in with an experimental jab toward my stomach. This wasnt a real attack, just him testing my limits. Id had a lot to drink, which would slow my reflexes. So had he. That changed the baseline, something we both needed to feel out.
0425280624	description	Cant believe they gave you a top rocker, he said, taunting me. I grinned.
0425280624	description	Try harder, old man. I know you too well.
0425280624	description	Painter laughed, then came at me again, suddenly. He punched me square in the stomach and I doubled over. Shit. I fell back and almost stumbled out of the ring, catching myself at the last minute. I heard the shouts of my brothers urging me on.
0425280624	description	Oh, hell no.
0425280624	description	No fucking way Id lose a fight tonight. Painter could fuck right off, because hed had his colors for years. This was my night. I owned this bitch and hed just have to suck it up and deal.
0425280624	description	Still staggering, I lurched forward toward him like I was out of control. Then I attacked, and this time I caught him. One hit, two. Three. Right in the gut. Painter gasped and I moved in for the kill.
0425280624	description	Somehow he pulled himself together, catching me across the chin. My entire head rattled as I staggered to the side. I felt blood in my mouth, then found a loose tooth with my tongue.
0425280624	description	Asshole.
0425280624	description	I thought of the pretty girl Id just seen, which pissed me off. The anger was good. Cleared my head. Didnt matter if I won or not, she wouldnt want to suck face with someone bleeding like a stuck pig. This wasnt a fightit was a cock-block.
0425280624	description	Time to end it.
0425280624	description	Painter waited for me, swaying. Id gotten him pretty good. He was definitely favoring his left hand, which was great news because he was left-handed. Lucky me. I was ambidextrous.
0425280624	description	I launched myself at him, turning that to my advantage.
0425280624	description	He tried to block me but his arm was weak. I landed a blow to his gut followed by one that caught the side of his cheek. Pain seared through my hand, parting the fog of alcohol.
0425280624	description	Dick, he managed to gasp as I danced back, flexing my fingers. That last one had been badif Id been any more off-center, Id have a fist full of broken bones.
0425280624	description	You got him, Boonie shouted. I stretched my hand again. Did I want to risk another head blow? I hadnt even wrapped my knuckles...
0425280624	description	Fuck it.
0425280624	description	I caught his chin again and Painter went down, falling hard. Blood dribbled from his nose and for long seconds I wondered if Id actually hurt him for real.
0425280624	description	Then he managed to roll onto his stomach, tapping out and flipping me off, all in one gesture.
0425280624	description	Congrats on getting your colors, Puck, he groaned. Ill give you this one. Enjoy it while you can because next time Im killing you.
0425280624	description	I staggered back, grinning and raising my hands once I realized he wasnt seriously hurt. Itd been a lucky shot and we both knew itwe were well matched, couldve gone either way. As I heard my brothers shouting in victory I didnt care. This was my night. I had my freedom and my patch.
0425280624	description	Still needed that girl, though.
0425280624	description	I looked around and spotted her standing next to Deep. Teeny stood on the other side of him, looking all sorry for himself. She was hugging herself with both arms, obviously nervous, and I felt my smile fade. Shit. I hadnt wanted her scared. I shook my head, wishing things werent moving so fast. Waving off the men crowding around me, I headed toward her, half expecting her to run off.
0425280624	description	She didnt, though.
0425280624	description	As I came to a stop in front of her, she gave me a wavering smile, then spoke. Can I help you find another drink?
0425280624	description	Fuck yeah.
0425280624	description	I took her arm and pulled her into my side, exchanging a satisfied look with Deep.
0425280624	description	Let me know if you need anything! Teeny yelled after us, and I felt the girl shudder.
0425280624	description	Christ, but hes a nasty little shit, isnt he? I asked her conversationally, and she gave a startled snort of laughter. I liked the sound. Sweet and sort of innocent. Made my dick happy, that was for sure. Still, I didnt want to fuck things up and push her too hard, because the skittish vibes were intense.
0425280624	description	Yeah, he is, she agreed quietly, and I leaned down to kiss the top of her head. She smelled goodfresh and clean, just like Id been fantasizing all those months inside. Fresh and clean and perfect.
0425280624	description	I wondered what shed taste like.
0425280624	description	Theyre lighting a fire out back, she told me, her voice soft. By the kegs. Maybe we should go over there?
0425280624	description	Hmmm... I could work with that.
0425280624	description	Okay.
0425280624	description	She tried to pull away from me then, but I caught her hand playfully, tugging her back toward me.
0425280624	description	I cant get you a beer if you dont let me go, she pointed out.
0425280624	description	Fuck. She was right. Still, I wasnt about to let her get away that easyknowing my luck, Painterd swoop in and take her, just to fuck with my head. If anyone could pull it off, he could. Fucker was pretty in his own weird wayeven I could see it. I couldnt compete, not with the nasty scar on my face.
0425280624	description	Id just have to keep a close eye on her, I decided. Protect what was mine.
0425280624	description	An hour later I found myself leaning back against the wall of the house, wondering how Id gotten so lucky. My girls name was Becca, and she was rapidly turning into my all-time favorite female. Not that wed talked muchshe was pretty quiet. But she was soft and warm, and now I had her tucked between my legs, leaning back against me.
0425280624	description	Skittish hadnt been the right word for her, either. Shed been nervous as hell, so nervous Id been afraid at first shed pull a runner on me. Beer helped with that, and now she was relaxed into me, eyes closed, head turned toward my chest so that my chin brushed her forehead. Id have said she was asleep if it wasnt for the little noises she made every time my fingers circled her nipples under her shirt, or slid down her stomach.
0425280624	description	Wed pushed up the bra about ten minutes ago, and Id explored down below just enough to know she wasnt sopping wet for me yet... but she was getting there. This was a good thing, because my dick was harder than a rock and ready for more. I shifted my hips, sliding my erection against her back, and groaned.
0425280624	description	Feeling her up in the firelight was great, but time to move things along.
0425280624	description	I pulled out one hand, catching her chin and tilting it up for a kiss. God, she was sweet. She tasted like sunshine and beer, with a hint of tequila mixed in for good measure. I could tell she didnt have a ton of experience, because when I slid my tongue into her mouth she wasnt quite sure what to do with her own.
0425280624	description	Turned me on in a big way, gotta admit.
0425280624	description	Becca, you should take him on upstairs, dont you think?
0425280624	description	Teenys voice cut through the kiss, and Becca stiffened. She pulled away from me, shutting down so hard I could practically feel the arctic chill. Fuck. For an instant I gave serious consideration to killing Teeny. Itd taken me nearly an hour to get her to this point, and he was not going to fuck it up for me.
0425280624	description	I stared him down, eyes narrow.
0425280624	description	Is there a reason youre talking to her?
0425280624	description	He smirked.
0425280624	description	Just making sure its all good here.
0425280624	description	Go away.
0425280624	description	Take him upstairs, Becca. If anything, she got more tense, and I groaned. Sure, I could just go find someone else. But I didnt want anyone else, and this asshole was ruining things for me. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her into me, tight, making it clear that she didnt need to worry about Teeny.
0425280624	description	Now would be a real good time to disappear, I told him, my voice full of a quiet menace designed to convey one messagefear. Becca shivered, which pissed me off. Been hard enough to get through to her, and now she had to see this. Otherwise Ill make it happen. Got me?
0425280624	description	Boonie came to stand next to us.
0425280624	description	We got a problem here? he asked.
0425280624	description	No, Teeny said, glaring at me and Becca. Then he turned and scuttled off like the fucking roach he was. She shivered, and I rubbed my hands up and down her arms.
0425280624	description	Dont worry, babe, I told her absently. Thanks, Boonie.
0425280624	description	No prob, he muttered looking after Teeny. Glad were leaving in the morning. Theres something wrong herebeen a very educational trip.
0425280624	description	I nodded, although I didnt have the full story. Theyd fill me in later, so until then Id just follow Boonies lead.
0425280624	description	Lets go inside, Becca said. Find some privacy.
0425280624	description	She pulled free and stood up. This startled me, but I wasnt exactly unhappy about the development. I lurched off-balance as I rose, and things were a little hazy around the edges. Wasnt messing with my dick, though, so all good where it counted. She led me into the house and up the stairs to a small room in the back. It had a twin-size bed that was rumpled and stained. There was a puddle of beer spilled on the floor next to a turned-over bottle. More cups and bottles littered the area, and an ashtray was half full on the bedside table.
0425280624	description	Guess we arent the first ones looking for some privacy, I commented, but I didnt really care. Nope. I just shut the door and locked it. When I turned back, shed already stripped down to her bra, and was busy unzipping her jeans.
0425280624	description	Holy shit.
0425280624	description	Becca was gorgeous.
0425280624	description	I mean, Id seen how pretty she was outside, but those sweet little boobs Id been groping the last hour were even more perfect than Id imagined. Somehow the fact that a plain cotton bra cradled them just enhanced the experience. Then she slid her pants off and I nearly died because Id never seen anything sexier. I wanted to tie her down and take possession of every hole in her body. Twice.
0425280624	description	Becca saw it all written in my faceclearly it scared her. She took a step back, and held up a hand. A deeply disturbing question flickered through my foggy brain.
0425280624	description	Are you a virgin? I asked, the words tasting strange in my mouth. She gave a harsh laugh, then shook her head.
0425280624	description	No, Im not a virgin.
0425280624	description	She reached behind to unhook her bra and I saw her nipples for the first time. Pink and pointy and gorgeous, exactly the right size for my mouth... I stepped toward her and she surprised me, dropping to her knees and reaching for my fly.
0425280624	description	How long has it been? she asked, her voice almost businesslike. I groaned as she pushed down my jeans and briefs, cock springing free. Id never been harderwasnt entirely sure Id survive the next ten minutes. Fuck, would I even last ten minutes? Then her hand wrapped around me and I closed my eyes, reaching out to lean against the wall because otherwise I wouldve fallen flat on my ass.
0425280624	description	She started out slow and steady, wrapping her fingers around me and rubbing up and down. After a minute she paused. I opened my eyes to see her peeking up at me as she licked her palm, looking older and more seductive than Id pegged her before. Fuck. Fuck. Then her other hand reached down to cup my balls as she started working me again with all ten fingers.
0425280624	description	I gasped, falling into the sensation again. Definitely wouldnt be lasting that long, I realized. No way. But that was just fine, because tonight I had a lot more than one load saved up and ready to go.
0425280624	description	Use your mouth.
0425280624	description	She obeyed, opening up and taking me in, her tongue flicking at me expertly. Almost too expertly... weird, and a little surprising, given how she kissed. Then she sucked me deeper and I stopped thinking at all. Everything was warm and wet and fucking perfect.
0425280624	description	Thirty seconds later I blew up in her mouth without warning. Hell, it caught me off guard, it happened so fast, and I cringed. Reaching down, I caught her hair in my hand, pulling out the rubber band holding it so the long, brown strands fell around her face. She stood, wiping her face with the back of her hand, soft brown eyes meeting mine.
0425280624	description	She looked like an innocent little angel again.
0425280624	description	Becca, that was... I didnt have the words. God, Id missed sex. Real sex, not just jacking off in my hand. Nothing in the world quite as sweet as the feel of hot wet woman wrapped around my dick.
0425280624	description	She turned away, reaching down to grab a half-empty fifth of rotgut vodka off the bedside table, taking a big drink, and swishing it around her mouth. Then she spat it out on the floor so it mingled with the pooled beer before taking another swig.
0425280624	description	Okay, not a total angel.
0425280624	description	I reached out, and Becca handed the bottle to me wordlessly. Then she slid off her plain cotton panties and laid back on the bed.
0425280624	description	You ready? she asked. I drank deep, my head spinning because Id never been more ready for anything in my life. She didnt look ready, though. Her eyes were distant, and when I kicked off my pants and stepped between her legs, I could see her body wasnt with me, either.
0425280624	description	Fortunately I knew how to fix that.
0425280624	description	Pulling off my cut, I looked for somewhere safe to put it. The only available flat surface was the little table, but in the back corner was one of those hanging racks with some clothes on it. I walked over and grabbed a hanger, hung up the leather vest, and turned back to Becca.
0425280624	description	Shed closed her eyes, and Id have thought she was asleep if I didnt know better. Fuck, maybe shed passed out.
0425280624	description	You awake?
0425280624	description	She nodded her head.
0425280624	description	Yeah, just sort of drunk, she muttered. Dont worry about it.
0425280624	description	Shrugging, I pulled off my shirt, then knelt down beside the bed and caught her legs up and over my shoulders. She squawked as I spread her pussy lips, giving her a long lick straight up to her clit.
0425280624	description	What are you doing? she demanded, suddenly awake and alert. I licked her again, and Becca squirmed and gasped as her little nub started to harden for me. Nice. Oh my God! I cant believe how good that feels...
0425280624	description	She fell back on the bed as I got going. I love pussy. Of course, most men do, but not all of them love going down on a nice, juicy cunt as much as me. I licked and tickled, every once in a while giving a little nip as Becca came to life under me. I think she was trying to keep still at first, but no way was I having any of that shit. Nope. I wanted her soaking wet and screaming, because I planned to ride her hard the rest of the night.
0425280624	description	Then I slid two fingers deep inside, searching for just the right spot as I sucked on her clit like candy. Found it on the first try, and she blew up around me, crying out and sobbing. I pulled away, grabbing a chunk of loose sheet to wipe off my mouth, and she moaned, little shivers running through her body.
0425280624	description	Id been hard for her beforealmost constantly, even right after Id come in her mouthbut that was nothing compared to my cock now. Fluid seeped from the tip, and I reached across the floor for my pants, pulling out a condom. Along the way the vodka caught my eye and I took another drink, following her lead as I swished out my mouth and spat on the floor.
0425280624	description	The place was truly disgusting, but Id spent fourteen months in prison so a little filth was the least of my concerns. Tilting back my head, I sucked down the rest of the booze, swaying as I stood. I caught her under the arms and scooted her up the bed before I slipped on the condom. Seconds later I pushed deep into her. Fuck, this had been the right call tonight, becauseI shit you notnever felt anything that good before in my life.
0425280624	description	She moaned and I caught her mouth with mine, kissing her hard and claiming her. This time I didnt hold back. Nope. I just took as much as I could, savoring her sweet taste and wondering if she wanted to see Idaho... Wed be leaving in the morning, and the thought of throwing her on the back of my bike and taking her along worked for me in a big way.
0425280624	description	Then she squeezed down on me hard and I stopped thinking altogether.
0425280624	description	We slept for a while. Maybe we passed out. Dunno. Same difference. When I woke up, Becca was tucked into my side, one leg thrown over mine. Her hair trailed across my chest and her breath tickled my skin.
0425280624	description	Thats all it took.
0425280624	description	I rolled her over onto her stomach, sliding a pillow under her hips and spreading her legs before grabbing a condom. She murmured, not really talking, but the sounds coming out of her mouth werent unhappy when I found her clit again. Seconds later I pushed into her. Im sure some mansomewhere in historyhad enjoyed the feel of a womans cunt more than I did in that moment. Hard to imagine how, though.
0425280624	description	Id taken off the edge earlier and now that I had her nice and warmed up, I was ready to do this thing for real. Grabbing her hips, I pulled back and slammed deep. Becca screamed and stiffened, now well and truly awake. Fuck, so hot and slick... I started pumping in and out of her hard, loving how she convulsed around me. Her arms reached out, clawing the sheets, and I lowered myself across her back, using my knees to spread her legs out even wider. Then I caught her hands in mine, nipping at the back of her neck before groaning into her ear.
0425280624	description	Reach down below and finger your clit.
0425280624	description	I cant, she gasped. I paused, catching her hand and shoving it down beneath her stomach as I lifted my weight. We found her clit together, then I shoved back into her roughly.
0425280624	description	Oh my God... she moaned. Thats incredible.
0425280624	description	Damn straight.
0425280624	description	Now keep it there, I ordered. Youre going to come for me at least twice, got it?
0425280624	description	She nodded into the sheets and I pulled my hand free, bracing myself as I started moving again. It wasnt gentle, but that was okay because I felt how wet and slick she was around me. Tight, too. Even better than Id imagined back in my cell, and I have a hell of a good imagination. I leaned up on my elbows, catching her hair and jerking it back because I get off on that shit. Each twist of my hips took me closer, and when she started convulsing around me and crying, I nearly lost it. Not quite, though. I wasnt finished.
0425280624	description	Mouth. Cunt. Ass.
0425280624	description	Id planned it all out in my head, dreamed about it for months... Now I finally had the staying power to finish it. As she shuddered and trembled, I pulled free and sat back on my heels. Beccas ass spread wide in front of me, and I smiled because it was fucking gorgeous. Heart shaped, pretty. Not too big, but not fucking skinny and nasty like a half-starved donkey, either.
0425280624	description	Christ, I wanted to fuck her there.
0425280624	description	My cock was still wrapped tight and dripping with her juices, but I spat into my hand a couple times for good measure, slathering it on for a little extra lube. Then caught her hips and pulled her up and onto her knees.
0425280624	description	Brace yourself.
0425280624	description	She nodded, stretching out her arms in front of her like a cat, which was cute but totally inadequate under the circumstances. I caught her hair again, yanking her head to the side. Becca gasped.
0425280624	description	I said brace yourself, I repeated. Gonna fuck your ass now.
0425280624	description	She squawked, and her entire body stiffened.
0425280624	description	That a problem? I asked. She shook her head quickly.
0425280624	description	No, do it.
0425280624	description	Shit, could she sound less enthusiastic? I stilled, realizing my prison dream girl might not be up for the full porno fantasy in living color. Fuck.
0425280624	description	Its okay, I said, pulling back. I closed my eyes, running a hand through my hair and shuddering. Id just fuck her cunt some more. I could do that. Then she shocked the hell out of me by reaching around behind to grab my cock. She pushed back with her hips, awkwardly trying to guide me to her asshole, which was funny and pathetic at the same time.
0425280624	description	Because Im a shitty human being, I went for it.
0425280624	description	Not a complete dick, though. I could see the tension radiating off her.
0425280624	description	You never done this before? I asked her. She shook her head violently, not looking at me.
0425280624	description	Okay, well go slow.
0425280624	description	She nodded this time, but she still didnt give me her eyes. It bothered me for some reason, although why, I had no fucking idea. I dug my fingers deep into her hair, twisting her head around enough to kiss her. Hard. My tongue dug deep, forcing her to kiss me back and, I shit you not, I felt like fireworks were going off in my head. Clichd as all fuck, but there you have it. After long seconds we came up for air, and I stared into her eyes, seeing how her pupils grew wide.
0425280624	description	Slowly, steadily I found her opening with my cockhead, pushing in as she gasped.
0425280624	description	You okay?
0425280624	description	Im fine, she said, eyes wide, her lips trembling. I held her there, my heart beating so hard I thought it might come right out of my chest as I drove down deep. She was tightreally tight. Sure as hell hadnt been lying when shed said shed never done this before. I sank into her for what felt like forever before I hit bottom, balls resting against her pussy. Her heartbeat pulsed around my cock and I realized that I would be happy to die in that moment. Thats how good it was.
0425280624	description	Becca closed her eyes and turned her face into the covers, spasming around me. I didnt like the positionI wanted to watch her facebut she seemed to need some privacy. I got it. Ive never been a nice, vanilla kind of guy, but this was a different kind of intensity than even I was used to. No screaming, no scratching, no fighting with each other until we both lost our minds... No, this was powerful on a whole new level, and looking into her eyes was probably too much for me, too.
0425280624	description	I pulled back out, then slid in again. She gasped.
0425280624	description	Play with your clit some more.
0425280624	description	She nodded without speaking, burrowing her hand back down until she found her target. I started moving, going slowly and carefully at first. But it felt really good, and Ive never been one to take things slow and careful.
0425280624	description	Looking back, I cant decide if thats when things really fell to shit, or if theyd been falling to shit all along and I was just too stupid to see it. Never have figured that one out, but what happened next was not my finest hour. I started moving faster. It felt fucking amazing. She felt fucking amazing. Then I was pounding her and she was shuddering and I thought she was coming and it was perfect.
0425280624	description	Becca sobbed suddenly. Loud. Not a pretty crying kind of noise, and not one of those moans bitches give when theyre getting off so hard they cant quite control themselves.
0425280624	description	No.
0425280624	description	This was the kind of noise a puppy makes when you kick it, and I felt it all the way down to my gut like a knife ripping me open.
0425280624	description	Big. Fucking. Mistake.
0425280624	description	I pulled out and caught her up and into my arms. She flinched and I hated myself, because even like that she was soft and pretty and I just wanted to keep nailing her ass. Becca knew it, too, because she tried to pull away from the press of my cock against her back. More sobs escaped and tears rolled down her face and I knew for a fact that Id burn in hell for this.
0425280624	description	Rubbing her head, I tried to think of soothing noises. Instead I was full of questions. Why had she let me do it?
0425280624	description	Cause youre a pushy, scary bastard.
0425280624	description	Fuck.
0425280624	description	Im sorry, I told her, my head starting to spin. Shouldnt have drunk so much. I had no idea what time it was, no idea how long wed been up here... I heard noises outside, the sounds of music and the party still going, but that didnt mean much. A good party could last all night and into the next morning.
0425280624	description	Its okay, she finally managed to whisper, and I bit back a harsh laugh because that was a huge fucking lie and we both knew it. Then she did something that blew me away. Becca turned in my arms and pushed me down onto my back. Seconds later she had the condom off and was sucking me deep again, which made no fucking sense at all.
0425280624	description	Unfortunately my dick wasnt the sensitive, caring type because it really didnt care that she was clearly so scared and drunk off her ass shed lost touch with reality.
0425280624	description	I couldve stopped her.
0425280624	description	I shouldve stopped her.
0425280624	description	Instead I sank my fingers into her hair and blew up into her mouth and it was even better than the first time. The room was seriously spinning all around me as she tucked into my arm and stroked my chest.
0425280624	description	Tell him I did good, okay? she whispered. Just tell him I did good. Please?
0425280624	description	I passed out, wondering what the fuck she was talking about.
0425280624	description	My bladder was about to explode.
0425280624	description	Needed to pee. Maybe rinse out my mouth, too, because it tasted like something died in there and that was not an exaggeration. Shifting, I realized that Becca was still tucked into me, sleeping heavily. I managed to crack my eyes open, blinking. Faint light was creeping in through the window, although even now I could still hear music down below.
0425280624	description	Great. Gonna be a long ride home with no sleep. Sliding carefully out from under Becca, I stood and pulled on my pants. My shirt had fallen into the sticky puddle of beer and vodka, so I stumbled out of the room half naked. The door across the hall was locked, although from the smell it had to be the bathroomeither that or people had started pissing and vomiting in the bedrooms, which I supposed wasnt entirely impossible. Felt great to be back with my brothers, but our hosts kind of sucked ass. Bunch of assholes and meth heads, so far as I could tell. No wonder Boonie didnt trust them.
0425280624	description	I walked down the stairs into the living room, where despite the fact that music still blared, people were passed out all over the place. My brother Deep leaned back against the bar separating the living room from the kitchen area, arms crossed, a look of faint disgust on his face.
0425280624	description	Hey, I said, keeping my voice low.
0425280624	description	You look like death. Have fun up there?
0425280624	description	I shrugged, feeling like an asshole.
0425280624	description	Shes perfect, I said. But I think I hurt her.
0425280624	description	His eyes narrowed.
0425280624	description	We got a situation? Should I go get Boonie?
0425280624	description	Shit.
0425280624	description	No, not like that, I said quickly. I mean, I think I pushed her too far. Tried to fuck her ass, and it didnt go over so well. Shes okay, but I still feel like a douche.
0425280624	description	We got a girl whos gonna cry rape? he asked quickly, and I snorted.
0425280624	description	Probably should, I replied. She told me to do it, though. Afterward she sucked me off. Feels wrong, somehow.
0425280624	description	You want another drink? I turned to see Teeny standing there, his beady eyes bright and full of something I couldnt quite follow. God, I hated himhe was like a cockroach that wasnt smart enough to stay out of the light.
0425280624	description	Anger replaced my disgust. He needed to leave me the fuck alone.
0425280624	description	Are you serious? I asked him, turning and cracking my knuckles. The fight with Painter had taken off my edge, but itd come back again as I told Deep about Becca. Hitting someoneanyonewould feel good, but hitting this guy? Thatd be a flat-out pleasure. God, dont you ever go away? Fucking piece of shit!
0425280624	description	I started toward him, but Deep caught my arm, pulling me back.
0425280624	description	Careful, bro, he said quietly. This isnt about him. Youre pissed about the girl. Pick your battles, because theres a lot more Longnecks than Reapers and Bastards combined. All he did was offer you a drink.
0425280624	description	Fuck. I breathed deep, looking at the scared little shit and wishing desperately hed do somethinganythingto give me an excuse to take him down. My brothers would back me no matter what, but I wasnt stupid enough to think there wouldnt be a price for my actions.
0425280624	description	Im going back to bed, I said after a tense minute or so, pulling free. Talk to you later, brother.
0425280624	description	Deep nodded, watching Teeny as I turned and stalked back up the stairs. This time the bathroom door was open. Sure enough, someone had missed the toilet, and I felt my own stomach heave sympathetically. For a sec there I thought I might lose it. Then I pulled it together enough to piss without barfing. Afterward, I turned to look at myself in the mirror. As always, the face looking back at me was ugly as fuck. Dark, ragged hair. Scar cutting across my face. Nose thatd been broken at least four times now...
0425280624	description	Shit, no wonder Becca had been scared of meI looked like a fuckin serial killer. I wanted to punch the mirror and break it into a thousand pieces, which would accomplish even less than beating the shit out of Teeny.
0425280624	description	Instead I went back into the room and found her still sound asleep on the bed. Her skin was pale and fragile, dark shadows ringing her eyes. Still gorgeous, but younger and more frail-looking now. Christ. What had I done? I crawled back into bed with her, sure Id never get to sleep. Id underestimated how much booze was still floating around in my system, because everything went dark again.
0425280624	description	This time the sun was bright and harsh. I blinked, trying to remember where I was... Then it all came back and I looked around, wondering where my girl went.
0425280624	description	Shit. Becca was gone.
0425280624	description	What the hell really happened last night? I sat up, spotting my colors hanging from a rack next to... school uniforms? Fuck, some kid must live in this room, I realized. Thatd suck, coming home to a mess like this. I turned and lowered my feet on the far side of the bed, figuring Id open the window to air things out, check the lay of the land in the process. I stepped on a pile of books, which fell over. I reached down to pick one up.
0425280624	description	Textbook.
0425280624	description	I picked up another. Shit, it was another textbook, and under that was a notebook. Thats when I started to get a very bad feeling in the pit of my stomachsomething I wouldnt have pegged as possible, given how shitty I already felt about how the night had played out.
0425280624	description	The notebook opened in my hands, and I saw the name Becca Jones written on the top of the front page, along with English: First Period and the date.
0425280624	description	Below were notes.
0425280624	description	Maybe she was in college, I thought desperately. Please, fuck... let her be in college. A piece of colored paper fell to the ground, and I dropped the notebook to pick it up.
0425280624	description	What I saw nearly made me throw up.
0425280624	description	It was a flyer for a dancea high school dance.
0425280624	description	Becca was still in school. Jailbait. The fuck? It didnt add up... Then her last words to me sank in, and it all added up far too well.
0425280624	description	Tell him I did good, okay? Just tell him I did good. Please?
0425280624	description	I flew down the stairs half dressed, my boots thudding loudly. My shirt was filthy from her floor, but my cut was still finesafe and sound after a night spent hanging next to Beccas little school dresses. Fucking piece of shit pimp Teeny.
0425280624	description	Had to be him.
0425280624	description	This was his house. Who the hell was she? His kid? What the fuck kind of asshole pimped out his own daughter? But shit, I guess it happened all the time, all over the world. About halfway down I heard her scream, which shouldve woken up everyone all over the goddamned house. Most of them were still passed out drunk, though. I heard more shouts outside and knew my brothers were probably coming.
0425280624	description	That turned out to be a good thing, because I came damned close to ending a mans life that dayfucking craptastic way to start parole...
0425280624	description	Teeny stood in the center of the kitchen, Becca huddled at his feet as he kicked her. Then he whacked her across the head with a fucking soup pot, of all things, and I lost my shit.
0425280624	description	You cocksucking asshole! I shouted, launching myself at him. Fucking twat! Ill kill you!
0425280624	description	My fists destroyed his face with a crunch. It felt goodcathartic. He fell like a bag of concrete and some part of my brain noted vaguely that Becca was scrabbling away from us, chunks of her long hair torn loose and left on the floor. Blood, too. Another woman shouted and tugged at her, but I didnt turn to look.
0425280624	description	Nope. I had work to do.
0425280624	description	Specifically, I needed to kill Teeny with my bare hands. Then Id tear him apart and eat his heart. Raw. He screamed like a bitch the whole time, and I heard Boonie yelling in the background. Then they hauled me off his ass, kicking and fighting because Id well and truly lost my shit.
0425280624	description	What the fuck is happening here? Picnic Hayes demanded. Beside him stood one of the Longnecks, a guy who looked a fuckuva lot like Teeny and I realized this must be the brother who was part of the club. Bax.
0425280624	description	Bax wasnt a happy camper. Fair enough. I was pretty fucking unhappy myself.
0425280624	description	Teeny moaned on the floor, rolling onto his back, and I spat at him. Then I heard a sobbing noiseone thatd already been burned into my brain. Becca was crying, and I looked over to find her huddled up against Teenys old lady.
0425280624	description	Shit. I hadnt seen it before because the woman was so nasty and used up, but under that scrawny, tweaker body was an older copy of Becca. Had to be her mother... Even with the meth eating her, though, she seemed too young. If that was the mother, she mustve had Becca really fucking early.
0425280624	description	She his daughter? I asked her, my voice like a knife. The woman shook her head quickly, lips quivering. You let him pimp her out?
0425280624	description	She looked away.
0425280624	description	Damn, Picnic said. This is a hell of a clusterfuck.
0425280624	description	Im not leaving her here. Hell kill her.
0425280624	description	Pic shook his head slowly, thoughtfully, but I could see it in his facehe knew I was right.
0425280624	description	Yeah, she can come with us, he said. You up for that, Boon?
0425280624	description	My president nodded, eyes never leaving the huddled mass of blood and human filth crying on the floor.
0425280624	description	Well head out in twenty minutes, Boonie said decisively. Anyone got a problem with that?
0425280624	description	He looked around the room in challenge, and several of the Longnecks glanced awayapparently they werent going to stand up for Teeny. Said a hell of a lot about them in general and Teeny in particular. I mean, I was glad that we werent fighting our way out, but thats just pathetic. They were happy to party with him. When it came time to take his back, they were gone.
0425280624	description	Cmon, lets go upstairs and grab some of your shit, I said to Becca, reaching toward her. She gave a little scream and pushed back with her feet, sliding across the floor to get away from me. Fuck.
0425280624	description	Ill get her ready, the mother said suddenly. Her voice quavered, but her eyes were resolute as they met mine. Shell go with youjust get her away from here. Hell hurt her bad for this. Real bad.
0425280624	description	I nodded, watching as she drew her daughter to her feet, then pushed her toward the stairwell.
0425280624	description	Jesus, you can sure pick em, Boonie said. How old you think she is?
0425280624	description	Shes still in high school, I said, my voice grim. Fairly certain Im up for statutory if this goes down wrong.
0425280624	description	Damn, Painter said, coming up behind me. Thats fast workusually takes a little longer to violate parole, bro.
0425280624	description	I met his gaze, and for once his face didnt hold even a hint of mockery. Fuck. This was really bad.
0425280624	description	Outside, Picnic said sharply. Horse, Rugeryou stay here. Make sure the girl gets out safe, okay?
0425280624	description	He caught my arm and pulled me toward the door. Boonie flanked us, and I sensed real danger beneath their calm expressions. We walked over to the bikes as the others scrambled to grab their shit and pack up.
0425280624	description	I wont leave her, I told them again. I know shes scared of me, but I dont give a fuck. That girlll die if she stays here.
0425280624	description	Not gonna leave her, Pic said. But we do need to get out fast, before they have time to figure out what happened and get pissed off. They decide to fight for her, thingsll get ugly. Not sure we can take em.
0425280624	description	Thanks for standing with me.
0425280624	description	Boonie snorted.
0425280624	description	Youre our brother, Puck, he said, his voice casual. This is what we do. You went down for us, you think we arent prepared to do the same for you? Now pull your shit together. We can put the girl in the truck with the prospects, or you can take her on your bike. No time to fuck around.
0425280624	description	Fifteen minutes later, I watched as Horse, Becca, and her mom walked out of the house. At least thirty members of the Longnecks MC stood watching, talking quietly among themselves. I kept waiting for one of them to reach for a gun or challenge us, but they didnt.
0425280624	description	No sign of Teeny.
0425280624	description	Becca had stopped crying, but her face was still covered in tear-smeared blood, and nasty bruises were popping up all over. Her breath sounded wheezy, too, and I hoped to hell she didnt have broken ribs.
0425280624	description	I dont want to go, she whispered, catching at her moms arm. I want to stay with you.
0425280624	description	Youre getting out, the woman replied, her eyes hard and calculating. Let him cool off, then well talk. Figure something out.
0425280624	description	Becca shook her head, but when I caught her arm gently she let me pull her away.
0425280624	description	You want to ride in the truck or on my bike?
0425280624	description	Becca glanced at the truck, eyes widening at the sight of two Reaper prospects. Ill stay with you.
0425280624	description	I nodded and climbed on my bike, eyes alert as I monitored our audience. She climbed up behind me, and then her mother gave a satisfied nod. Becca wrapped her arms around me and I felt her tits press tight against my back. My cock stirred to life. What the fucking hell was wrong with me?
0425280624	description	How old are you? I asked, my voice low.
0425280624	description	Sixteen.
0425280624	description	Shit.
0425280624	description	Like, youre almost seventeen?
0425280624	description	No, I turned sixteen last week.
0425280624	description	Double shit.
0425280624	description	Boonie kicked his bike to life, and we followed his lead, pulling away from the house in formation.
0425280624	description	So thats the story of how I committed statutory rape less than twenty-four hours out of prisonon my birthday, no less. In retrospect, I probably shouldve stayed inside, served out my full five-year term. Wouldve been less work for everyone.
0425280624	description	ONE
0425280624	description	CALLUP, IDAHO
0425280624	description	PRESENT
0425280624	description	BECCA
0425280624	description	Order up.
0425280624	description	I turned to the window and grabbed the ticket, looking over everything to make sure Blake had gotten it right. He was a damned good cook, but sometimes he was a little loose in his interpretation of an order... especially if he was hungover.
0425280624	description	And he was definitely hungover today.
0425280624	description	In fact, I think he mightve still been a little drunk when he dragged his ass through the back door at five that morning. I know Danielle was, because she was all giggly and unsteady when shed started the breakfast shift with me.
0425280624	description	I think Im going to barf, she whispered into my ear, leaning against the counter. Heh. Guess someone was finally sobering up. Can you cover my tables for a few? I cant let Eva catch meshe said shed fire my ass if I fucked up again.
0425280624	description	I got it, I said, snatching up toast and throwing it onto a little plate, along with a couple of jelly packets. Go take care of businessshes talking to Melba and you know how they get. Youve got fifteen minutes at least, so make the most of it.
0425280624	description	She nodded and ducked back through the kitchen. I heard Blake growl at her for getting in his way and had to smile. I didnt think it was a coincidence that theyd both shown up looking like hell. There was a story behind that growl, and if I knew Danielle, itd be a good one.
0425280624	description	Loading my tray, I hoisted it up and over my shoulder, carrying it out past the counter and into the main dining room. The Breakfast Table was the heart and soul of Callup, at least in the mornings. Everyone came in to see and be seen, because the food was good and it was cheap. We opened at five thirty a.m. so the miners and loggers could grab a bite before work, and we closed up again by two in the afternoon, although I was only on until eleven. At that point Id hop in my car and drive over the pass to Coeur dAlene to spend my afternoon at the beauty school.
0425280624	description	Only six more months and Id be ready to take my boards.
0425280624	description	The thought put a little smile on my face as I hauled my tray over to Regina and Earl, an older couple who owned the old building downtown that held my apartment. The smile got bigger when I saw Regina was wearing the blouse Id made her last week...
0425280624	description	Here you go, I said, feeling all sorts of pleased with myself. One Belgian waffle with strawberries and bacon on the side. One pork chop with hash browns, toast, and applesauce. You good on coffee?
0425280624	description	Youre right on top of things, Becca, Earl said, eyeing his chop with anticipation. He had one every morning. Didnt seem like such a bright idea to me, considering hed already had one heart attack, but every time I tried to talk to him about it he blew me off.
0425280624	description	These must be some of Honeys strawberries, Regina said, popping one into her mouth. The store-bought ones arent as sweet.
0425280624	description	Yup, I told her. Enjoy them while they lasttheyll be gone in a week or two.
0425280624	description	Order up! Blake shouted, ringing the bell in the pass-through window.
0425280624	description	Thats me, I said, leaning over to give Regina an impulsive hug. Shed been the one to take me in when Id first arrived in Callup five years ago. Id been bruised, terrified, and so lonely for my mother it hurt. And yeah, I realize its crazy to miss someone who treats you like shit, but deep down inside were all just babies crying for Mommy, you know? Regina took it all in stride, holding me tight through the nightmares as I slowly rebuilt myself into something human.
0425280624	description	It took Teeny six months to forgive me after Puck and I rode north. Mom had called all excited, saying I should come back home. Earl declared Id be leaving over his dead body, and that was the end of it. Id lived with him and Regina through high school and while I spent a year working and saving up my money. After that they gave me one of their apartments over the old pharmacy building at the friends-and-family rate.
0425280624	description	Regina and Earl were the best thing that ever happened to me, and I loved them for it.
0425280624	description	Lookin good, Becca, said Jakob McDougal, settling himself at the counter. Today he had four of his buddies in tow. He was loud, rude, and one time hed left me a penny underneath a turned-over glass of water for a tip because his breakfast steak was overcooked. (I dont know if youve ever seen someone do that, but its a straight-up dick moveone that takes real effort, too.)
0425280624	description	Long story short, Jakob McDougal was an asshole.
0425280624	description	He also wasnt real bright, because after pulling that shit he still thought he had a shot at getting me naked, no matter how many times I shot his ass down. Now I resisted the urge to flip him off because I was still six months away from dumping this gig to start cutting hair, and Eva could be a real bitch if we were rude to the customers, even if theyd earned it. (Eva could be a real bitch about a lot of things, which was part of why I was working so hard to get my license and leave the waitressing behind.)
0425280624	description	Ill be with you in a minute, I told him, my voice tight, because guys like him pissed me off. Giving him my back, I reached for the next ticket and prepped my tray.
0425280624	description	Im tired and need some coffee, Jake said, ignoring the fact that Id just told him I needed a minute. Dumbass. His friends Cooper, Matt, Alex, and one other I didnt know laughed like a chorus of braying jackasses. I was up laaaate last night making Sherri Fields a very happy girl, and I want something to get me up again. I got needs, baby.
0425280624	description	The jackasses grunted and snickered, giving each other high fives. One of them made a slapping noise and another moaned in a way that I suspected was supposed to sound like the unfortunate Sherri Fields in the throes of ecstasy. More like a dying elk, in my opinion.
0425280624	description	I counted to ten and stared at the plated food in the window, jaw clenched. Blake caught my gaze, and his eyes narrowed. Uh-oh. Blake wasnt a big fan of customers giving the waitresses shit at the best of times, and he got mean when he had a hangover. I saw him reach for his big, flat metal spatula with the sharp edge on one side and my eyes widened.
0425280624	description	Crap. Did I want Jake and his friends to suffer? Absolutely. But not if it got me fired.
0425280624	description	Its all good, Blake, I said quickly. He shook his head slowly as Jake and his friends laughed harder. Thats when I remembered theyd gone to school with Blake, over in Kellogg. Seniors together on the football team. Then the other guys got jobs at the Laughing Tess mine... Blake had claustrophobia, so he slung hash browns in the mornings and went to community college in the afternoons. He was a smart guy, and personally I thought he had a much brighter future ahead of him than the losers behind me.
0425280624	description	I felt his pain, though. Taking the high road can wear a person out.
0425280624	description	We got an issue here? a deep voice asked, sending shivers all up and down my spine. I closed my eyes, wondering if the day could possibly get any more fucked up. That was the voice that haunted my dreams, although I hadnt heard it for six months. (Six months and eight days... give or take. Not that I was counting.)
0425280624	description	The voice belonged to Puck Redhouse.
0425280624	description	The same Puck Redhouse whoin one monumentally fucked-up night five years agomade me come harder than I knew was possible, poked me in a most uncomfortable place, and then set me up to get my ass kicked when he complained about how bad I was in the sack.
0425280624	description	I sort of hated him for that.
0425280624	description	The next morning hed hauled me all the way back to Idaho and deposited me on Earl and Reginas doorstep like a lost puppy. After that he disappeared into the night. I saw him around on and off, but the guy was mysterious.
0425280624	description	Kind of like Batman. On a motorcycle.
0425280624	description	In a weird way, I owed him everything... the man still scared the shit out of me, though. Scared me, turned me on, you name it, because if there was one constant derailing my quest for happy normalcy, it was Puck Redhouse and his stupid, sexy voice. The man was my own personal North Atlantic iceberg, lurking under the cold waters, just waiting to shred me wide open.
0425280624	description	Fucking biker. Id had enough bikers to last a lifetimeI didnt need him in my life.

0804176795	description	Chapter 1Sometimes you have to stand alone, just to make sure you still can.UnknownFableTwo months. I havent seen or heard from him in two freaking months. I mean, who does that to a person? Who spends the most intense week of his life with another human being and shares his most intimate thoughts, his craziest, darkest secrets, has sex with a personand were talking amazing, earth-shattering sexleaves her a note that says I love you, and then bails? Ill tell you who.Drew Im-going-to-kick-him-in-the-balls-next-time-I-see-him Callahan.Ive moved on. Well, I tell myself that. But time doesnt stop just because my heart does, so I take care of my responsibilities. Ive stretched the three thousand dollars I earned for my one week of pretending to be the jerkwads girlfriend pretty well. I still have some money left in my savings account. I bought my brother, Owen, some cool Christmas gifts. I got my mom something for Christmas, too.She didnt buy either of us anything. Not one thing. Owen made me a shallow bowl he created in his ceramics class at school. He was so proud to give it to me. A little embarrassed, too, especially when I gushed over it. The kid wrapped it in bright Christmas paper and everything. I was blown away that he took the time to actually create something for me. I keep that bowl on my dresser and leave my earrings in it.At least someone gives a crap about me, you know?He didnt give Mom anything. Whichshallow witch that I ampleased me to no end.January is supposedly a time of healing. New year, new goals, resolutions, whatever you want to call them, when a person should be hopeful with all that unchartered territory spread out before her. I tried my best to be positive when the new year came, but I cried. That clock struck twelve and I was all by myself, tears running down my face as I watched the ball drop on TV. Pitiful, lonely girl sobbing into her sweatshirt, missing the boy she loves.Most of the month is gone, and thats fine. But the realization hit me last night. Instead of dreading every single day that comes my way, I need to savor it. I need to figure out what Im going to do with my life and then actually do it. Id leave if I could, but I cant ditch Owen. Without me, I have no idea what would happen to him and I cant risk it.So I stay. I vow to make the best of this life I have. Im tired of living in misery.Im tired of feeling sorry for myself. Im tired of wanting to shake my mom and make her see that she has children she should give two shits about. Oh, and that she also needs to find a job. Sleeping all day and partying all night with Larry the Loser isnt the way to deal.And Im tired of mourning the loss of a beautiful, fucked-up man who haunts my thoughts everywhere I go.Yeah, Im most sick of that.Pushing all mopey thoughts out of my head, I go to the booth where a customers waiting for me to take his order. He came in a few minutes ago, a blur of a tall man who moved quickly, dressed too nicely for a Thursday mid-afternoon jaunt to La Salles. The bar is hopping at night, full of college kids drinking themselves into oblivion. But during the day? Mostly bum losers who have nowhere else to go and the occasional person coming in for lunch. The burgers are decent, so theyre a draw.What can I get you? I ask once I stop in front of the table, my head bent as I dig out my order pad.Your attention, maybe?His questionspoken in a velvety deep voicemakes me glance up from my notepad.Into the bluest eyes Ive ever seen. Bluer than Drews, if thats possible.Um, sorry. I offer him a tentative smile. He instantly makes me nervous. He is waaaay too good-looking. Like beyond gorgeous, with dark blond hair that falls over his forehead and classic bone structure. Strong jaw, sharp cheekbones, straight nosehe couldve walked right off a billboard. Are you ready to order?He smiles, revealing even white teeth, and I clamp my lips shut to prevent them from falling open. I didnt know men could be this attractive. I mean, Drew is gorgeousI can admit that even though Im furious at him. But this guy . . . he puts all other men to shame. His face is too damn perfect.Ill take a Pale Ale. He flicks his chin at the tattered menu lying on the table in front of him. Anything from the appetizer menu you can recommend?He must be joking. Beyond the burgers, I wouldnt recommend any food La Salles serves to this ideal male specimen. Heaven forbid it might taint him. What are you in the mood for? I ask, my voice weak.Lifting a brow, he picks up the menu and glances it over, his gaze meeting mine. Nachos?I shake my head. The beef is rarely cooked all the way. More like it comes out with a pink tinge. So gross.Potato skins? He winces.I wince back. So nineties, dont you think?How about the buffalo wings?If you want to set your mouth on permanent fire. Listen. I glance around, making sure no oneas in my bossis nearby. If you want something to eat, I suggest the caf down the street. They have great sandwiches.He laughs and shakes his head. The rich, vibrant sound washes over me, warming my skin, followed quickly by a huge dose of wariness. I dont react like this to guys. The only other one who could earn this sort of reaction from me is Drew. And hes not around . . . so why am I still so hung up on him?Maybe because youre still in love with him, like some sort of idiot?I shove the nagging little voice that pops up at the most inopportune times into the back of my brain.I like your honesty, the man says, his cool blue gaze raking over me. Ill just take the beer, then.Smart decision. I nod. Ill be right back.I head toward the back and slip behind the bar, grabbing a bottle of Pale Ale, glancing up to catch the guy staring at me. And he doesnt look away, either, which makes me feel uncomfortable. Hes not watching me like a pervert; hes just very . . . observant.Its unnerving.A trickle of anger flickers through me. Do I wear an invisible sign around my neck? One that says Hey, Im Easy? Because Im not. Yeah, I made a few mistakes, looking for attention in the wrong places, but its not like I dress with my tits or ass hanging out. I dont put any sort of purposeful swing to my hips, nor do I thrust my chest out the way I see plenty of girls do.So why does every guy I encounter seem to blatantly check me out like Im a piece of meat?Deciding Ive had enough of his crap, I stride toward his table and set the beer in front of him with a loud clunk. Im about to walk away without saying a wordscrew the tipwhen he asks, So whats your name?I glance over my shoulder. Whats it matter to you? Oh, Im such a bitch! I could really piss this guy off and get myself fired. I dont know whats wrong with me.Im almost as bad as my mom. She sabotaged her job with her drinking and awful attitude. At least I only have the bad attitude.If I could kick my own ass, I would be doing so right now.He smiles and shrugs, as if my smart-ass remark doesnt faze him. Im curious.Turning fully, I face him, studying him as intently as he studies me. The long fingers of his right hand are wrapped around the neck of the beer bottle, his other arm resting on the scarred and scratched table. His entire manner is relaxed, easy, and my defenses slowly lower.Its Fable, I admit, bracing for the reaction. Ive heard endless jokes and rude remarks about my name since I can remember.But he doesnt give me a hard time. His expression remains neutral. Nice to meet you, Fable. Im Colin.I nod, not knowing what else to say. He both puts me at ease and shakes me up, which leaves me confused. And he definitely doesnt fit in at this bar. Hes dressed too nice and has an air of authority about him that borders on entitlement, as if hes above it alland he probably is. He reeks of class and money.But hes not acting like an ass and he should, Ive been so rude to him. He brings the beer bottle to his lips, taking a drink, and I watch unabashedly. Hes handsome. Hes arrogant. And hes trouble.I dont want anything to do with him.So, Fable, he says once hes downed half his beer. Can I ask you a question?Shuffling my feet, I glance around the bar. No ones paying us any attention. I could probably stand here and talk to Colin the mysterious customer for fifteen minutes and no one would protest. Sure.Why is a woman like you working in a shit bar like this?Why is a guy like you ordering a beer in a shit bar like this? I retort, momentarily insulted. But then I realize . . . hes complimenting me. And he referred to me as a woman. No one ever does that. I dont do that.He tips his beer at me, as if offering a toast. Touch. Would you be surprised if I said I came in here looking for you?

0990429202	title	Under Locke
0990429202	description	Mariana Zapata began writing love stories soon after she learned how to spell. She probably shouldn't admit that she started sneaking romance novels from her aunt's bookshelves way before she was old enough to even understand what it meant when a man flipped up a woman's skirt. (Don't tell her mom.) Luckily, she learned to love the process of two people falling in love instead of all the other juicy stuff. Mariana lives in Houston, Texas with her longtime boyfriend and two beloved (and emotionally manipulative) Great Danes, Dorian and Kaiser. When she's not pretending to write, she's reading. You can usually find her burning somewhat edible experiments in the kitchen or cracking jokes at the expense of her family members.

0991127390	description	Gabe Hyde is on borrowed time. He's been hiding his identity for over four years-hidden from the world that used to adore him--obsess over him--driven to the edge of insanity by one poor choice. But that one choice, altered the course of his life forever. Pretending isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially when pretending means hiding your real self from the people that care about you the most. But if anyone ever discovered the truth it wouldn't just be his life at risk--but hers.
0991127390	description	Saylor doesn't hate men. Just Gabe. Only Gabe. He's a reckless, happy-go-lucky, silver spoon fed pain in her ass. Everything about him makes her more and more confused. Unfortunately they both donate time at the same Group Home. If she wasn't afraid of flunking, she'd be long gone. She hates that she's attracted to him almost as much as he hates that he's attracted to her--and she can tell, especially since their first encounter ended up making her knees so weak she couldn't form coherent sentences for weeks afterwards. But the closer she gets to him, the more confused she becomes. He isn't who he says he is, and he's hiding something big.
0991127390	description	What happen when two worlds collide? Two worlds that never should have met in the first place? Some secrets are too big to be hidden forever--the only question? Will his destroy everyone he loves? Or finally bring about the redemption he's been craving for the past four years?

1250109302	title	One with You (Crossfire)
1250109302	description	"Prolific erotic romance author Day's fifth Crossfire novel brings the story of Gideon and Eva to a satisfying conclusion. The couple, now wed, are attempting to keep their marriage secret until they can celebrate with their loved ones, but multiple threats by vindictive people from their pasts undermine that effort. Savvy in business and social media, the two lovers cleverly combat their enemies while also managing to nourish their personal relationship through therapy, friends, and steady integration into each other's families. Narrating their stories in alternating chapters, Eva and Gideon relate their explosive physical attraction, their appreciation of how they help each other heal old emotional wounds, and their ever-increasing mutual trust. In one particularly moving scene, when Gideon desperately begs Eva to believe that he did not cheat on her despite what looks like incriminating evidence, her simple ""I believe you"" offers a stark contrast to his childhood experience of being disbelieved when he reported abuse. Glamorous people, swanky settings, steamy sex, and passionate married love make this a heartwarming, gratifying conclusion to the series. (Apr.)\n"
1250109302	description	"""Gideon and Eva's complicated relationship plays out with hurt, passion, obsession and most importantly, love. Day's writing is flawless and carries readers on the journey of these two broken characters toward each other and the all-consuming emotions that leap out of the book. A wonderful story written by a master storyteller!"" - RT Book Reviews, Five Star Gold ""By not holding back any punches and truly saving the best for last, Sylvia Day has given these characters the ending they've always deserved, the ending I've always hoped for, the perfect conclusion to a story that remained poignant and electrifying until the very last page. And even though nothing could have ever truly prepared me for the end of a series that has meant so much to me for so long, a spectacular send-off such as this helps in no small measure."" - Natasha is a Book Junkie, 6 Stars ""This was one of my most highly-anticipated books of the year and it delivered everything I'd hoped for and more!! ...I was left with such a full-filled and satisfied feeling that I couldn't be happier with the way their story concluded. Sylvia Day really did justice to this series because the ending was gorgeous. I truly loved it and highly recommend the Crossfire series to everyone as a top favorite!!"" - Aestas Book Blog, Top Favorite""What I loved best about this finale was how intimate and emotional it felt. We get that wonderful happy ending we've been longing for, cheering for, but their happily ever after is just beginning. They'll surely encounter more difficulties, as well as celebrate many, many moments of happiness. And perhaps that's what I most loved about this book... it may be the end of the series, but it's not the end of their story, and that's a wonderful thing to think about."" - Vilma's Book Blog, 5 Stars"

1476718202	description	Reckless  Chapter 1 Temporary Bliss I was stirred from sleep by a hand running up my thigh. Smiling, I stretched my tight limbs and placed my palm over the wandering fingers. The hand was warm and soft, and clasped mine, cinching tight. A cool ring of hard metal dug into my skin as he held me in his firm grasp and I smiled wider, fingering the matching band on the ring finger of my hand. Id gotten married last night . . . in the spiritual sense, at least. A soul-filled pledge of undying devotion was enough for us right now. And really, a formal ceremony and a piece of paper wasnt what made a marriage. It was the feeling bursting apart my chestthe overwhelming sensation that Id been cleaved in two at birth, and, miraculously, Id managed to find my other half. And even more miraculously, he felt the same. Soft lips touched my shoulder, and I snuggled further into the body seeking my solace. The sheets wrapped around us were the finest linens Id ever slept in, but their luxuriousness paled in comparison to the man beside me. With his warm legs tangled around mine, his broad chest flush against my back, and his arms circled over and under me cradling my body to his, he was far more comfortable than the overpriced bed. Pulling the fingers laced with mine up to my lips, I kissed the promise ring on his left hand. A low chuckle escaped him, then those sensuous lips of his worked their way up my neck. Warm and content, my skin instantly pricked with goose bumps as small bolts of electricity shot right through me. When he got to my ear, he whispered, Mornin, Mrs. Kyle. My heart was instantly thudding in my chest. I twisted in his embrace until I could see him. Eyes the color of a twilight sky stared back at me, and a small smile curved his mouth as he searched my features. His face was perfectthe angle of his jaw, the slope of his nose, the fullness of his lips. At the moment, I couldnt recall anything quite as beautiful as the man whod just given me his name. Good morning, Mr. Kyle. A small giggle of disbelief escaped me, and Kellans smile widened. The contentment in his eyes was nearly palpable. It warmed my heart that I made him feel that way. Hed had enough pain in his life; he deserved peace. It was all a little surreal to me, the depth of his love, the fact that I inspired it. Sometimes, I didnt feel worthy of him, but I was grateful for him, every day. I cant believe we just did that, Kellan. He cocked an eyebrow, his grin instantly mischievous. What? Have mind-blowing sex? That really shouldnt surprise you. His expression softened into adoration. Every time with you is incredible. Biting my lip, I forced the flush he was making me feel aside. I wasnt talking about that. Reaching up with my free hand, I stroked his jaw with my finger. I meant getting married. Kellan propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at me. His gaze slid down to our hands locked together, to the ring encircling his finger. The look of contentment on his face shifted to outright bliss. Id never seen him happier.  Til death do us part, he whispered. Running my fingers down his chest, the hills and valleys of his absurdly defined body starting to ignite mine, I murmured, My parents wont accept you as my husband until you walk me down the aisle, you know. Remembering that Id left them a vague message on the answering machine at Kellans place, since they were still in town for my graduation yesterday, I frowned. They were going to be so pissed when they woke up and heard that Id run off and gotten married without including them. Honestly, I was a little surprised that my phone hadnt rung yet . . . or that the hotel room door hadnt been beaten down. Kellan laughed and repositioned our bodies so that he was lying on top of me. Giving him a soft smile, I ran my fingertips down his back. He shuddered. And I will. . . . Leaning down, he placed a kiss on my neck, then my collarbone. My heart sped up. I will give them the ceremony they want. . . . Looking up at me, he let his lips trail from my collarbone to the top of my breast. I struggled to not squirm. Ill give you the wedding of your dreams, Kiera. His lips closed over my nipple then, and all of last nights passion flooded back to me. As satisfying as our first union as husband and wife had been, I wanted more, I wanted him again. I didnt think Id ever stop wanting him in every way that that implied. Just as my fingers drifted up to thread through his hair, my breath long past casual, his lips left the erogenous zone that theyd found. I looked down at him right as he looked up at me. Crooking a grin, he kissed between my breasts, then down my belly. Just the thought of him continuing on his southern path had me instantly aching for him. His grin turned cocky, like he knew it. Ill give you everything, Kiera, but, until I can do it properly . . . His tongue dipped into my belly button before trailing down my abdomen. I groaned and closed my eyes, simultaneously shifting my hips up and pushing his head down. I heard a throaty laugh escape him as his lips traveled down my thigh. His breath hot against my skin, he finally finished his sentence, . . . we may as well enjoy the perks. Then his tongue brushed over my core and I lost all pretense of control.    It was several hours later that we were finally dressed and ready to leave our swanky hotel room. A quick inspection of my cell phone showed me that Kellan had turned it off sometime last night. I guess that explains why we hadnt had any interruptions. Smirking at him as he grabbed his jacket from the plush bench in front of the vanitya bench that wed christened last nightI turned my cell phone back on. A new voicemail alert chirped at me; I was sure there were several of them. Considering the fact that wed be seeing my very unhappy parental units soon, I didnt bother listening to the voice mails. I was pretty sure I knew what they all said anyway. What were you thinking? You cant marry him, Kiera. Get your ass back here so we can fly you home! Etcetera. They were going to take a while to accept this union. They were going to take even longer to accept the fact that I was soon to be hitting the road with my new husband. Even I was still in shock. Touring around the country with Kellan had been out of the question while I was still enrolled at school, but I was a graduate now, and I was free. I could do whatever I wanted. And I wanted to be with Kellan, wherever that may be. My dad was kind of old schoolgo to college, graduate, and get a good job. Kellan hadnt even gone to college. Hed run away from home right after high school and fallen into the Los Angeles music scene with Evan, Matt, and Griffin. Hed been playing with them ever since. Dad was mystified by Kellans life choices. And he was going to be furious with mine. But it was my life to live, and I was going to do what felt right. And being with Kellan felt . . . amazing. There was no place Id rather be than by his side. I wasnt giving up on my dreams to live vicariously through Kellans, though. No, I was going to strive to make my dreams come true too, and it just so happened that my dream job lined up perfectly with his. I wanted to be a writer, and that gave me a certain amount of freedom since I could do it anywhere so long as I had a bit of privacy. That might be tricky in a tour bus full of rowdy boys, but I was certain I could carve out a few hours every day to put something meaningful down on paper. I was in the middle of writing my first book, which was autobiographical in a sense, since it was based on actual events. It was a detailed, intimate depiction of everything that had happened between Denny, Kellan, and me. The love, the lust, the betrayalit was all in there. Writing it was torturous, but therapeutic. Taking a step back and looking at the situation through critical eyes, it was easy to see my many mistakes. There were points when I had been whiny, clingy, petty, wishy-washy . . . downright annoying. Seeing all of my flaws laid bare was a humbling experience. The book was so personal, I almost wasnt sure if I could let anyone else read it. Especially Kellan. But hed asked, and Id told him he could. I didnt want to go back on my word, so I would just have to reassure him with each painful page that I wasnt that weak, pathetic girl anymore. I knew what I wanted, and it was him. Scanning the room to make sure I wasnt forgetting anything, my eyes swept over the messy bed. The rich, red comforter was a jumbled mess, and the creamy, satin sheets beneath it were twisted as well. Kellan and I had made good use of the king-sized space, rolling around over every inch of it as wed explored each other. Our moans and cries of ecstasy were still reverberating through my head, and for the millionth time I was grateful that Kellan had agreed with my idea of renting a hotel room for our honeymoon. I couldnt imagine doing the things wed done last night at our place, with my parents in the next room. Coming up behind me, Kellan wrapped his arms around my waist. I inhaled deeply, savoring the fresh, invigorating scent that was uniquely his. Kissing my ear he murmured, We should go. I told Gavin I would have breakfast with him today, and were already really late. . . . Its more like brunch now. Looking over my shoulder at him, I couldnt contain my smile. Gavin Carter was Kellans biological father. Kellan had put off meeting the man for months; hed been terrified to see him. But theyd finally met yesterday, and now Kellan was going to try and have a relationship with the person whod helped create him. Twisting in his arms, I slung mine around his neck. Running my fingers through the back of his hair, I gave him a soft kiss. Im sure hell understand that your wedding night ran a little long. Kellan sighed and cinched me tight to him. His body flush to mine was hard and unyielding. My fingers itched to feel the curves of his defined physique, but that always led to him exploring mine, which usually led to a long, drawn-out lovemaking session . . . and we really did have to leave. Practicing as much restraint as I could, I kept my fingers tightly tangled in his hair. Kellan kissed my head. I still cant believe youre my wife. Nuzzling my face against his chest, I felt like my heart was going to burst open onto the floor. God, I loved him. Desire for him started building in me as we held each other, and I again had to repress the urge to express my love for him physically. Pulling back, I frowned. Youre right, we should go. Kellan smirked at my expression. You want to have sex again, dont you? Flushing, I pushed his chest away from me. I think we broke enough records last night . . . and this morning. I felt the heat in my cheeks and averted my eyes. Squatting in front of me, Kellan grabbed my chin and made me look at him. Do you want to have sex with me? he asked, not a hint of a tease in his voice. His question was so direct that I found it difficult to keep my eyes trained on his. I instinctively wanted to look away. I didnt, though. I made myself stare into his dark blue depths as I whispered, Yes. Kellan gave me a prideful grin. Was that so hard to admit? he asked, a gleam in his eyes. I started to close my eyes, but stopped myself. He wanted me to not be embarrassed around him. And he wasnt trying to tease me right now; he was trying to help me grow. Locking gazes with him, I nodded again. Actually, yeah, that was a little mortifying. Pursing his lips, Kellan shifted away from me. I want you to ask me to have sex with you . . . right now. My mouth dropped open. Kellan . . . Feeling self-conscious, I covered my chest with my arms. As I was still wearing the tight, slinky dress my sister, Anna, had let me borrow for my graduation ceremony, there was a lot of skin to cover up. Ive asked you for sex before. . . . Why are you purposely embarrassing me? Sighing, he leaned down again to meet my eye. Youve asked me in the heat of the moment, when we were heading in that direction anyway. I want you to feel comfortable enough to ask me anytime, anywhere. I cocked an eyebrow at him. Anywhere? Kellan gave me an impish smile. Anywhere. Knowing he wasnt going to drop this, I huffed out a disgruntled breath. Dropping my hands to my sides, I counted to ten. Really, this wasnt so hard. I should be able to ask him to have sex with me. Ive certainly used my body to ask him on several occasions. Bluntly saying it was different, though. It made me feel a lot more vulnerable. Lifting my chin, I confidently asked, Kellan, will you have sex with me? Well, I meant to say it confidently, but my voice came out high and squeakyanything but sexy. But by the look on Kellans face, youd think Id just given him a lap dance. His burning eyes slid down my body, igniting me. They lingered on my lips, my chest, my hips, and even though he wasnt touching me, my body responded like he was. When his bedroom eyes finally returned to mine, he took a step forward. His hip brushed against me and I gasped. Leaning down, his breath hot against my skin, he murmured in my ear, That is the hottest thing Ive ever heard you say. My eyes fluttered closed. I felt like I was vibrating, waiting for him to touch me. Every sensitive spot on me buzzed with anticipation. All he had to do was touch his lips to mine, brush a thumb over my breast, or cup my backside, and I would explode . . . I was sure. His lips closed over my earlobe and a low moan escaped me. But we have to go. With those words he grabbed my hand and yanked me forward. Startled at the sudden movement, my eyes flew open. His grin was amused as he backed toward the exit . . . and not the bed. I frowned at him as he laughed. Im sorry, Kiera, but youll just have to be unsatisfied for a while. Cocking his head, his smile grew wider. Thats sort of . . . karma . . . for all the times youve left me aroused and alone. Guilt crept toward me, but I pushed it back. Our past wasnt relevant anymore. Youre mean, I muttered. He kissed my cheek. Hmmm, maybe I am. Stepping into me, he grabbed my backside and pulled my hips into his. Fire swept through me instantly and I groaned a little before I controlled myself. Running his nose along my jaw, he husked out, Because Im really looking forward to teasing you all day. Irritated at how turned on I was, I pushed him back. You suck. He laughed as he opened the door. Grabbing my purse, I looked back at the rumpled bed that screamed A passionate romp happened here! Wait, Kellan. Should we make the bed before we go? Kellan bunched his brows as he looked between my face and the twisted sheets. Shaking his head at me, he murmured, Youre so adorable. His loving grin turned into amusement as he looked back at the bed. No, were leaving the room like it is. I want the world to know what happened here . . . on the night we consummated our marriage, he said, returning his eyes to mine. I sighed, moved by his words. Then he added, Besides . . . its hot. Rolling my eyes, I followed him out of our hotel room. The woman at the front desk kept her eyes on Kellan the entire time he checked us out. I saw her gaze flick down to his wedding ring when he handed her his credit card, but by the sparkle of interest in her eyes, I dont think she much cared that Kellan was married. Kellan was a breathtaking man, and gorgeous men attracted attention when they walked into a room. I was used to the reaction by now, and it didnt really bother me anymore. Well, at least it didnt bother me as much as it used to. The eager hotel employee frowned as she handed Kellan his receipt. By the flash of disappointment in her eyes when Kellan thanked her without even looking at her, I think shed been hoping he would ask her to join him upstairs. I refrained from smiling when her eyes finally shifted to me. She may have been hoping for a quick hookup with the hot man about to exit her lobby, but Kellan didnt do hookups anymore. Snuggling into Kellans side, I politely thanked her for the pleasant stay. I giggled after I said it, still a little high from my wedding night. Kellan kissed my head as he turned us toward the exit. When we get home, Ill call Gavin and have him come over to our house for brunch. Might as well have our two families formally meet, right? he said. Kellans smile was content and it warmed my heart. Hed referred to his father as family. That was a far cry from when he hadnt wanted anything to do with him. Yeah, sounds great. I cringed. My parents are going to kill me, though. I flashed my ring. And then kill you. Kellan only shrugged at my comment as he led us to his car in the parking lot. Gallantly opening my door for me, he gave me a peck on the cheek as I slid inside the Chevelle. He sprinted around to the drivers side with a huge grin on his face. He looked so happy to finally have me as his wife, to know that I was his and I wasnt going anywhere. Id always hoped that the man I married would love me beyond reason, but Kellan . . . loved me beyond anything. The depth of his love sometimes overwhelmed me, but my love for him was just as powerful. He was everything to me. As he stepped into the vehicle, I moved across the bench seat so I could be as close to him as possible. He grinned as he draped his arm over my shoulder. Miss me? he asked, his voice low and husky. Nodding, I leaned up to kiss him. Kellan eagerly returned my affection, his hand coming up to cup my cheek. I lightly flicked my tongue against his and he groaned, then pushed me back. Hey, Im supposed to be teasing you today, not the other way around. He had an adorable pout on his face, and I couldnt stop the giggle that escaped me. Sorry, I learned from the master. Kellan let out a dramatic exhale and removed his arm from around my shoulder so he could start his car. Serves me right, I suppose. The hearty engine growled to life, and Kellans content expression returned. My face was a mirror image of his as I lay my head on his shoulder. Even though the hotel receptionist had blatantly ogled my husband, even though my dad was going to try and ground me when I saw him again, and even though Kellans newly discovered father was going to be dropping by for a visit this afternoon, today was a perfect day; nothing was going to squelch my happiness. We turned onto Kellans cramped street, and a feeling of homecoming came over me. I had enjoyed our night away, but I was glad to be back at our place. And I was really glad that I had moved back in a few weeks ago. When Kellan pulled up to his white, two-story home, a car was parked in the driveway. Kellan glanced over at the bright red sporty Jetta and frowned. Curious about who was here, I looked over as well; the car didnt belong to anyone I knew. Shutting off the Chevelles engine, Kellan muttered, Hmmm, and cracked his door open. I opened mine as well, wondering if maybe Gavin and his kids were here. He was visiting from out of town. Maybe hed rented the car? Although I found it hard to believe that Gavin would show up without asking Kellan if he could come by first. Plus, he would have needed directions to Kellans house. And I really doubted that a rental car would have a bumper sticker on it that read: If youre gonna ride my ass, at least pull my hair. Knowing the driver was female and probably one of Kellans many, many ex-whatevers, I reluctantly followed Kellan to the front door. God, if some chick had shown up wearing only a long coat while my parents were here . . . I was going to die. The front door was unlocked and Kellan stepped through. Reaching back for my hand, he escorted me into our entryway. Kellans home wasnt the largest. From the front door you could turn right to go upstairs to the bedrooms, turn left to head into the kitchen, or go straight ahead to the living room. My parents were currently sitting on Kellans lumpy living room couch, a deep scowl fixed on my fathers face. My mother was trying to contain it, but I could tell she wasnt happy either. I wasnt sure if their disappointment was over my impromptu elopement or if they were irritated by the person lounging on Kellans comfortable chair, a chair that held a large amount of sentimental value for me since Kellan had given it to me when wed broken up. It meant a lot to me that Kellan had cared enough to think of me at a time when I really didnt deserve his kindness. Some strange girl sitting on it sideways, dangling her high heeled legs over the armrest, made my stomach tighten. Hearing our entrance, the girl tilted her head back so she could see the door. When Kellan got a good look at her, he muttered, Shit, and glanced down at me with a worried expression. The tightness in my stomach shifted to ice as I wondered who this girl was. Clenching my hand, Kellan walked into the living room so we could greet the new arrival. When we came into her view, she looked up at Kellan and narrowed her eyes. She had long black hair with equally dark eyes. She made them seem even darker by covering her lids with smoky gray eye shadow. Her lips were painted bright red and were pursed in an irritated, but erotic, pout. She was gorgeous, but Id been expecting that. Most of Kellans conquests were. Her face full of contempt, her voice low and husky, she bit out, Well, fuck me, Kellan Kyle. Amused at herself, she smiled and added, Oh, wait, you already did. As her scowl returned, my expression darkened; I already disliked this person. Ignoring her comment, Kellan acknowledged my parents first. Martin, Caroline. Then he shifted his gaze back down to the rude girl lounging on my favorite chair. Joey. My brows shot up my forehead as I stared at the girl glowering at Kellan. Joey? As in, the ex-roommate Joey? The girl who had lived here just a few weeks before Denny and I had moved in . . . over two years ago? I never thought shed come back. What the heck was she doing here now? Face tight, Kellan echoed my thoughts, What are you doing here? She hopped to her feet. Crossing her arms over her ample chest, she lifted her chin. Eyes fiery, she snarled, Where the hell is all my stuff, Kellan? Kellans mouth dropped a little and some anger seeped into his expression. Holding my hand a little tighter, he replied, Youve been gone for two years. I tossed it. I bit my lip to stop myself from cringing. I had actually tossed her stuff. Joey had run off in a huff after Kellan had slept with her then immediately slept with someone else. He wasnt always the sweet, loyal lover that he was now. Kellan had insisted that Joey didnt care for him, that she was just possessive. Hed offended her by sharing his bed with another woman . . . even though shed been sharing her bed with other men. Denny and I had used her furniture when wed moved in. After our bad breakup, the furniture had felt tainted to me, like the ghost of my ex-relationship had somehow infused into the dark wood. To purge the home, Id had all of her stuff taken away. Maybe I shouldnt have done that, since it wasnt mine to toss, but Id wanted it gone so Kellan and I could start fresh. I probably should have expected that decision to bite me in the ass. Her face theatrically outraged, Joey shoved Kellans shoulder back. You what? That wasnt yours to get rid of, asshole! Face heated, Kellan took a step forward. You ran out. Its not my problem if you left everything behind! Eyes disdainful, he scanned her face. My house isnt your personal storage unit. She scoffed and raised a hand dismissively. Whatever, Kellan. I dont need your temperamental crap. If you dont have my stuff, then you can just pay me for it. She smirked. Fifteen hundred should cover everything. I made a strangled noise and Joey twisted her head to glare at me. Who the hell are you? She raised an eyebrow. Kellans flavor of the hour? My dad rose to his feet, his cheeks flaming bright red. I dont know who you are, missy, but you cannot talk to my daughter that way! I was worried that my father might have a heart attack, he seemed so angry, but his rage was nothing compared to Kellans. Dropping my hand, he stepped up to Joey and stared her down. Be very careful, Josephine. Thats my wife youre talking to. Joey looked intimidated by Kellan for a moment and backed up a step. Then his words hit her. Her dark eyes bugged out and she openly gaped at me. Then she started laughing. Oh my God, are you serious? You, the biggest man whore I know, actually got married? What a joke. Kellan crossed his arms over his chest while my dad sighed and sank back down to the couch. He really wasnt pleased about this whole marriage thing. I thought I heard my mom sniffle, but I was too focused on Joey to look. My own temper was quickly rising, ready for this intrusive little bitch to leave. Kellan was too. Indicating the door, he told her, Fine. Ill get you fifteen hundred for the furniture. Now get the hell out. Joey shook her head. Oh, I dont think so . . . not anymore, Kellan. He cocked his head, not understanding. I didnt either. Hands balled into fists, I stormed up to her. You heard him! Youll get your money. I shooed her off with a hand. Now go back to whatever hole you crawled out of. Joey drilled daggers into me with her eyes. She kept her gaze on me, but spoke to Kellan. I have something of yours that Im returningshe looked up at himsince I have no use for it. Kellan bunched his brows and Joey smirked at his confused expression. And if you want it back . . . sweetheart . . . then youll double my price. Youre nuts, lady! I snapped. Joey ignored me, turning her eyes to Kellan. Then she leaned over and grabbed her bag off the chair, her short skirt exposing almost all of her thigh. Opening the bag, she pulled out a tiny, rectangular media card, the kind that fits into digital cameras, camcorders, and some cell phones. Kellans eyes widened when he saw it. He snapped his eyes to hers, and before I could ask what the hell was going on, he quickly told her, Fine, Ill give you three thousand. Throwing me a victorious smile, Joey handed Kellan the SD card. My mind was spinning over just what was on that card that Kellan was willing to pay so much money for. The fire in my belly shifted to nausea. Kellan clenched his hand around it, then pointed at the door. Ill get it to you tomorrow. Joey patted his cheek. You better . . . cause I will make your life a living hell if you dont. She glanced back at me with a wicked grin. Kellan closed his eyes. Get the hell out of my house, Joey. Reopening them, he added, And dont ever come back here. Waggling her fingers at my parents, Joey sauntered to the front door. No one moved or spoke as she left the house. When the sound of her car starting filtered in through the door, Kellan finally seemed to relax. Turning to my parents, he discreetly tucked the card he was holding into his pocket. Im sorry about that. I hope she didnt give you too much trouble while we were gone. My dads posture turned rigid as he looked up at Kellan. I could have sworn his graying hair was getting grayer by the second. Im more concerned about what the two of you were doing last night than your tawdry friend. Cheeks flushed, he looked between my new husband and me. Whats this about you running off and getting married? He focused his warm brown eyes on me. Have you lost your mind, Kiera? Mom sniffled again, and Dad patted her hand. I wanted to sit and talk with them about last night, but I was still shell-shocked. What the hell did Kellan have in his pocket? And why was it worth three grand to him? As Dad patted the couch insistently, Kellan looked back at me. His face was a mixture of amusement, resignation . . . and fear. I wasnt sure if he was doing it purposely, but hed angled his hips in such a way that I couldnt see his card-holding pocket anymore. I still knew that damn thing was in there, though. Kellan indicated that I should sit in the empty space beside my father, then pointed at the front door. Ill be right back. I want to go check on my car, make sure Joey didnt mess with it. Giving me a tight smile, he added, If she keyed my baby, you may need to restrain me, cause I might kill her. He laughed as he started to move toward the door. My words stopped him cold. Whats on the SD card? The amused smile instantly left Kellans face. Swallowing, he shook his head. Its nothing. Dont worry about it, Kiera. Ignoring my parents for a moment, I stepped close to Kellan. I tried to reach around him, to grab his pocket, but he nimbly stepped away from me. Trying very hard to control the anger roiling my stomach, I repeated, Whats on the card? Seeing that I wasnt going to back down, Kellan leaned in and whispered, Can we talk about this later . . . in private? I wanted to nod my head and sit down to explain my symbolic marriage to my worried parents, but I couldnt get the smirk on Joeys face out of my mind. Aware that I sounded like a broken record, but not able to stop myself, I asked again, Whats on the card? Irritated at me now, Kellan narrowed his eyes and snapped, What do you think it is, Kiera? We filmed ourselves screwing! Instant remorse crossed his face once he realized what hed just crassly told me. Kellan sometimes lost the filter on his mouth when he got annoyed, and Joey confronting him had put him on edge. I guess my incessant questions pushed him over it. My mouth dropped open and I felt like hed just doused me with ice water. I knew thats what he was going to say, I really did, but hearing him confess it hurt. My whole body felt cracked, torn. Eyes quickly watering, I murmured, You made a sex tape with her? My mom cleared her throat and shifted on the couch. Thats when I suddenly remembered that Kellan and I werent alone. No, I stupidly hadnt been able to wait until we were in private to start this conversation. I really wished Id been able to squelch my curiosity. Id give anything to not know that my new husband had a documentary of him banging another girl in his pocket. And Id really give anything for my parents to not know that too. Seeing my pain, Kellan came toward me, arms extended. Kiera, I can explain. I held my palms up to him as tears dropped to my cheeks. I didnt want an explanation right now. I just wanted to be alone. Turning from him and my parents, I darted up the stairs. I heard Kellan asking me to wait and my mom calling my name, but I ignored them. Slamming the bedroom door behind me, I tossed my shoes across the room, collapsed onto my bed, and let the tears flow freely. So much for nothing ruining my happiness.

1476765367	description	Pulse   Chapter One A Missed Last Encounter Emily leaned her head against the taxi window, watching the city lights of Manhattan with tear-soaked eyes. In a blur, the look on Gavins face as he had walked away from her a few hours before rushed through her mind. The closer she got to his building, and the further away she got from her past with Dillon, the more she felt as though her sanity and heart were hanging by a delicate thread. She shifted restlessly and her gaze fell on the glowing green light of the digital clock. It was nearly one oclock in the morning. A glimmer of hope flooded her body, and she squeezed her eyes shut, praying Gavin would take her back. As the taxi pulled up in front of his high-rise, she reached in her purse and pulled out a wad of cash. After handing the unknown amount to the driver, she swung open the door and stepped onto the sidewalk into the cold, late November air. Hey! the Middle Eastern driver called. You have to close the door, lady! Emily heard his words but paid him no mind. Her fumbling feet pushed her forward, kept her moving toward what she hoped would be a new start. A new future with the man she knew she couldnt live without. She pulled open the door and crossed the lobby. Sweat clung like decay across her flesh. With a trembling hand, she pressed the button for the elevator. Her nerves skyrocketed with love and anxiety. Once the elevator doors opened, she stepped inside and leaned against the wall, physically and mentally exhausted. As she tried to stop shaking, tears steadily fell. Unsure of Gavins reaction, Emily struggled to pull in a decent breath. She tried to tamp down the wicked emotions curling through her. The doors opened to what would either be a new beginning . . . or an end. Feet glued to the ground, she stood frozen for a moment, her eyes trained on the wall across the hallway. Vaguely aware of the elevator doors gliding closed, she became dizzy as she lifted her hand to hold it open. Slowly, she stepped out. Her vision tunneled as she turned toward Gavins penthouse, and her mind spun out of control with every possible scenario. She strained to focus on his words from earlier, allowing her fear to wane as her feet led her closer. Her pace quickened with every step. Once she reached his unit, her fears returned with a vengeance, anchoring heavy in her chest. With trepidation, she knocked on his door, each knock mimicking the fierce pounding of her heart. She wiped away tears as her body trembled from head to toe. The minutes ticked by with no answer, and she knocked again, harder. Please answer. She chanted the silent prayer while ringing his doorbell. With tears trickling down her cheeks, she stared at the peephole, envisioning him staring back. The thought of him watching her stung and cut a path through her heart. Please, she cried, ringing the doorbell again. God, Gavin, please. I love you. Im so sorry. Nothing. Hands still shaking, she reached in her purse and pulled out her cell phone. She dialed Gavins number. Eyes locked on his door, she listened to it ring over and over again. Youve reached Gavin Blake. You know what to do. Emilys heart clenched, tightened, and dropped into the pit of her stomach when she heard his voice. That sweet voice would forever haunt her if he didnt take her back. That sweet, pleading voice that had begged her to believe him. She hung up, dialed again, and listened once more. She didnt speak. She couldnt. Her frantic breathing would be the only message he would receive. Words . . . she had none. Emily pressed a hand to her mouth as the realization he wasnt forgiving her set in. For a few painful moments, she was silent. Then grief erupted in her chest. A torrent of tears flew down her cheeks. Her cries echoed throughout the hallway. She retreated and felt her back hit the wall. She stared at his door, the vivid memory of his face ingrained in her head. Searing pain surged and twisted in her gut as she slowly made her way into the elevator, her heart plummeting with its descent.    Shoulders slumped and spirit broken, Emily unlocked the door to her apartment. A small light above the stove cast a faint glow across the living room. Quieting her footsteps, so as not to wake Olivia, Emily made her way into her bedroom. Still shaking, a cloak of sadness enveloped her as she padded into her bathroom. She flipped on the light and stared at her reflection. The green eyes, once vivid with hope, held no semblance of life. She ran her fingers over her cheeks, muddied with mascara. Her face looked pale. Even worse, her heart was stricken with loss. She flattened her palms against the cool marble surface of the sink, hung her head, and wept, gulping for air as pain so deep blanketed her soul. Regret in the most brutal form tightened like an unforgiving noose around her neck. She tried to calm down by turning on the hot water and splashing her face. After reaching for a towel, she dried herself and shut off the light. Fatigue slowed her feet as she made her way to her bed, and she curled up on her side. Exhausted, she sank into the mattress, attempting to gain a few hours of sleep. But that wouldnt come. No. As seconds, minutes, and hours ticked by, Gavins pained face and confused blue eyes invaded Emilys conscience. She drew in a shaky breath, rolled onto her back, and stared at the ceiling. Over the next few hours, swells of gut-wrenching pain rippled across her heart. Shed let him slip through her fingers.    Trying to ignore the ear-piercing sound of Blake Industries private jets engines firing up, Gavin wondered if Emily would remember things hed never forget. Wondered how this was truly the end. Hed lost her. In less than seven hours, she would be Dillons for good. He tugged his suitcase from the back of Coltons Jeep, his heart sinking further into his stomach as he peered into the clear, cold night sky. Colton stepped onto the tarmachis expression no more at ease than itd been when Gavin came to him. You dont have to do this, little man, Colton yelled, tufts of his dark hair whipping around in the engines fury. Bouncing out of the city in the middle of the night wont bring her back. Gavin wasnt sure if leaving would erase the mark Emily had seared into his soul. He also wasnt sure if hed ever be free from the ache of needing her. The only emotion he truly fucking owned . . . he knew he had to get out of New York. Get the fuck out, and get far away from the ghost of Emily that would no doubt haunt him. I told you, I need to get off the grid for a while, Colton, Gavin argued, roughing a hand over his face. I cant be here. Just take care of switching our stocks out of Dillons hands. Colton released a weighty breath and nodded. Ill take care of it first thing Monday morning. He clapped Gavins shoulder, his eyes softening. You have to be good with all of this when you get back. Promise me youll put Emily to rest while youre down there. Gavins chest palpitated at the sound of her name. Yeah, he replied, his voice grave. Ill try. After a few moments of staring at each other, Gavin climbed the stairs to the jet. Turning, he watched his brother drive off the property of the small, private airport. Mind-fucked and in the deepest turmoil of his life, Gavin dug into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out his cell phone. Without looking at it, he tossed it onto the runway. It shattered when it hit the ground. Off the grid meant off the grid. No contact with anyone. No one trying to pull him from his pain, and no one trying to convince him his actions were destructive. After handing his bags to the flight attendant, the pilot came out to greet him. Good evening, Mr. Blake. The pilot, gray hair spilling over his forehead, firmly shook Gavins hand. Everything youve requested has been prepared, and we should arrive in Playa del Carmen in just over four hours, sir. Gavin gave a weak nod and headed into his private cabin. He closed the door, and his eyes immediately landed on a minibar bottle of bourbon screaming his name. He gazed at it with contempt. Darkness seeped in around him. He peeled off his coat and tossed it onto the bed. Trying to stave off the evil angel invading his thoughts, he strode across the small space and reached for the mind-numbing amber liquid. Deciding to forgo a glass, he twisted off the cap and brought the bottle to his lips. The alcohol burned his throat, offering up not an ounce of reprieve from his pain. It was then that Gavin knew there would never be a time in his life he wouldnt be aware of Emilys absence. Drunk or sober, she would riddle his heart and soul until the day he died. He loved her. Breathed her in as if she were the air around him . . . the air he would be deprived of forever. He put down the bottle, ran an exhausted hand through his hair, and attempted to cast visions of Emilys beautiful eyes staring back at him from his memory. He walked over to the window, peering out at the city below, and knew it didnt work. Nothing would. Neither soaking his pain in alcohol nor running from her could mend what he was feeling. She was gone. As the twinkling lights faded with the jets climbing altitude, Gavins heart continued to mourn the woman hed lost while his mind wondered how long he would be at her funeral.    With the morning light sucking the last of the stars from the sky, and without a minute of sleep claimed, Emily sat up and made her way into the kitchen. Nausea filled her stomach. She reached for the refrigerator door, pulled it open, and grabbed a bottle of water. She sank into a seat at the table as Olivia rounded the corner. Hmm, I see Douchenugget dropped you off early this morning, Olivia clipped, glancing at Emily. She walked over to one of the cabinets and tugged it open. How nice of him to allow his bride to actually get ready on her wedding day at her place. Olivia, Im Before you defend Dillmonster, or your delusional thoughts, Emily, I want you to know how upset Gavin was last night. Olivia slammed the cabinet closed. Ive never seen him so hurt. Emily closed her stinging eyes, her heart constricting at the thought of the pain shed caused Gavin. She shook her head. Olivia, please. Im not I know, Emily. Youre not in the mood to talk about this, she huffed, yanking open another cabinet. Or let me guess, youre not delusional thinking you should marry Dillon because you dont believe Gavin? Olivia, Emily let out, rising. Youre not listening to me. Im not Olivia whipped around, her brown eyes narrowed. I fucking hate saying this, Em, but I cant be a part of this today. You love Gavin, and Gavin loves you. Done deal. I believe Gavin, and even if you dont, youre forcing me to choose. She placed one hand on her hip and rushed the other through her thick blonde hair. Im sorry, but Im not going to the wedding today. Good, because neither am I, Emily whispered, sitting back down. Im not marrying Dillon. Eyes wide with shock, a smile split Olivias face. Youre not? she gasped, rushing to Emilys side. Emily shook her head as a fresh round of tears seeped from her eyes. Olivia kneeled beside her and wrapped her arms around Emilys waist. Her words tumbled out against Emilys stomach. Oh my God, oh my God. Youre so not on my shit list anymore. I fucking love you to death right now! I hurt Gavin. Emily nearly choked over her words. I wanted to believe him, and part of me did, I guess, but I was afraid, and now its too late. Confusion peppered Olivias expression as she stood, bringing Emily with her. She cupped Emilys cheeks. Its not too late. As soon as you call him, hell forget everything. Gavin loves you. He was pissed last night, but he would die for you. Believe me. Thats all he kept saying. Trembling, Emily sucked in an unsteady breath. No. I went to his penthouse last night, and he didnt open his door. She backed away from Olivia and tucked herself into a seat at the table. I called his phone a few times, and he didnt answer. Hes done with me, and I deserve every bit of pain coming to me. Emily shook her head, her voice trailing off. I cant believe I let this happen. He didnt have me take him home last night. Olivia dropped to her knees again and grabbed Emilys hands. From the rehearsal dinner, he had me bring him by Coltons house. What happened sobered him up a little, but Im pretty damn sure homeboys still knocked out. Think about how tanked he was. Its only seven in the morning. He probably didnt hear his phone. Ill call him in a little while, but you need to try to calm down, okay? Emily slowly pulled her hands away and pressed the heels of her palms against her eyes. She reluctantly nodded, swallowing some of the worry coursing through her mind. Okay, Ill try to calm down. A slow smile touched the edge of Olivias mouth. Im proud of you, Emily. Proud of me? she questioned, wiping her nose with the back of her hand. For what? For hurting Gavin? His face, Olivia. I cant get his face out of my head. Eyes softening, Olivia brushed her hand against Emilys jaw. Im proud of you for finally seeing you deserve a better life with a man who honestly loves and cares for you. Again, you may have temporarily hurt Gavin, but the two of you are going to be fine. Youll see. Emily stared at Olivia and allowed a flutter of hope to settle through her limbs. She nodded, praying Olivias statement would prove true. All right, Olivia said, standing and looking at her watch, your un-wedding day is supposed take place in a little less than four hours. What do you need me to do, other than go get us some coffee because theres none here? You definitely look like you can use a cup, and I know I can, too. Olivia walked to the hall closet, pulled out her coat, and slipped it on. Do you want me to call your sister? She halted midstride. Better yet, can I call your ex-future husband and tell him to fuck off? Emily rose and moved across the kitchen. She grabbed a paper towel and blew her nose. The thought of Dillon waking to find her gone sent chills up her spine. He doesnt know yet. Confusion pinched Olivias forehead. What do you mean? I thought I left after he fell asleep, Emily interrupted, rushing her hands over her face. He has no idea. Youre the only one who knows. Olivias jaw dropped open, her eyes wide. Umm . . . okay. I could be wrong, but shouldnt the expectant groom know this? On a sigh, Emily walked past Olivia into her bedroom. She started rummaging through her dresser drawers. Other than Gavin, the only thing she craved was a long, hot shower. Yes, Olivia. I need to clean myself up, and when Im done, Im going to call him. Olivia leaned against the doorway, concern edging her eyes. Can you at least wait until I get back from the coffee shop? Ill shoot Lisa and Michael a call to let them know whats going on, okay? Knowing Olivia was worried, Emily slid her drawer closed and gazed at her. Yes. Ill wait. She walked over to Olivia, her eyes soft. Thank you. Olivia cupped Emilys chin, giving it a light shake. Youre welcome. Go ahead. Get in your shower, and Ill be back in a few. Emily nodded and watched her leave. After the front door snapped shut, Emily couldnt help but feel dread scorching her stomach. Confronting Dillon, with or without Gavin by her side, wouldnt be easy. She sighed, trying to ignore its festering presence. She made her way into the bathroom, set her sweatpants and sweatshirt on the vanity, and turned on the water. As hot steam curled through the air, she stripped last nights clothing from her body and slipped into the shower. She reached for the bar of soap and slowly ran it across the aching flesh between her legs as visions of what shed allowed Dillon to do to her invaded her thoughts. With her head hung low in shame, her drenched auburn hair formed a curtain over her face. Her every muscle felt bruised, but the soreness paled in comparison to her battered and beaten heart. She sank further into the darkest recess of her mind, replaying what hed done last night over and over. It was nothing short of a nightmare. It was then that she realized the enormity of what shed allowed him to get away with over the past year. The awareness of how shed deceived herself into thinking he loved her, cared for her, for them, knocked the air from her. The overwhelming, deep-seated obligation shed felt toward him for the things hed helped her with was something she knew brought her to this very moment. Anger at herself swelled, bubbling low in her belly as she scrubbed faster, harder at her flesh, over her arms, face, and legs. She wanted to remove his very existence from her pores. She turned the water on hotter and cringed at the way she had let him manipulate her every action. Her every thought. Crying, she sucked in a deep breath and tried to pull herself back together. Dillon was no more. They were no more. He was gone. Through her daze, Emily rinsed her body of not only bubbles lathering her skin but also the malicious venom hed poured into her soul. She stepped from the shower, reached for a towel, and pulled it around herself. Standing before the mirror, she glanced at the woman shed part ways with. Forever. Never again, she whispered. She shook her head, smoothed her hands over her cheeks, and pressed her eyes closed. Never. After taking a moment to reflect on the insanity the day promised to bring, Emily slipped into her clothing, dried her hair, and made her way back into her bedroom. She jerked to a halt when she heard her phone buzz, the sound alerting her there was a message waiting. Sudden anxiety it was Dillon and possible hope it could be Gavin gripped her. Swallowing, she edged toward the nightstand and, with a trembling hand, reached for her phone. Both her anxiety and hope evaporated upon seeing it was a voice mail from Lisa. Emily gave into the fatigue chasing her, sank onto her bed, and rested her head on a pillow. As she listened to her sisters concerned voice, Emily heard the front door creaking open. She sat up and took in the last few seconds of Lisas message, notifying her that she and Michael were on their way. Liv? Emily called as she slid her phone shut. She tossed it onto the bed, ran a palm over her face, and stood to make her way into the other room. I hope you got something to eat while . . . She paused in the living room archway, her words trailing off. Startled, she froze, silent and alert, when she found Dillon casually leaning against the counter. His eyes traced over her as he sipped orange juice from a glass. When I woke up, you were gone, Emily. After setting down the glass, he sauntered over, a cocky smirk plastered on his face. That excited to get back here and get all prettied up so you can marry me today, huh? He brushed his fingers against her cheek. I figured Id stop by before I went to Trevors to get ready. Get away from me, Dillon, she whispered, her voice shaky. She jerked away, trying to hide the fear rushing through her veins. Dillon blinked, clearing the roughness from his throat. With narrowed eyes, his face filled with confusion. What? he asked, stepping closer and grabbing her upper arm. Emily yanked it from his firm grasp, her shoulder slamming against a curio cabinet as she stumbled back. You heard me. I said get the fuck away from me. Her words dropped from her mouth in a low hiss. Im done, Dillon. Thisshe pointed between themis over. Im no longer your willing victim. Before she knew it, he had her pinned against the wall, one hand gripping her hair as the other clenched her chin. He ran his tongue across his bottom lip and studied her. You did fuck him, didnt you? Though a small cry pressed from Emilys mouth from the pain searing her skull, her answer dripped out as a sneer. Yes, I fucked him. Yes, Im in love with him, and no, Im not now, nor will I ever marry you. Even as fear doused Emilys limbs, a sense of relief and freedom took over, rooting somewhere deep inside. For half a heartbeat, she closed her eyes, allowing visions of Gavin to seep into her thoughts, but a hard crack to her cheek from the back of Dillons hand sent her eyes wide open. The sting rippled across her flesh as she thrashed her fists against his chest in an attempt to break free. With one hand still tangled in her hair, Dillon jostled her across the room like a worn out little toy. Landing on all fours against the wooden floor, Emily tried to stand, but Dillon grabbed her hair and forced her down. You sick fuck! she screamed, curling her hands around his wrists as he hovered above her. Dillon dropped to his knees and yanked her head back, forcing her to look into his eyes. After everything Ive done for you, you turn around and fuck him behind my back? he snarled, fisting her hair tighter. Pulse thudding and using every bit of her strength, Emily clawed and dug her nails into his skin as she tried to untangle his hands from her hair. Youve done nothing for me but break me down! she cried. When he wouldnt release her, a jeering smile split her face. Tears slipped down her cheeks. I wish I couldve fucked him right in front of you! Eyes glacial, hollow, and darker than the night sky, Dillon struck her face again. Emily felt the skin above her brow rip open, pain needling her flesh. A gasp tore past her lips as warm, thick blood trickled along her temple, snaking down her cheekbone. Still gripping her hair, Dillon pulled her up and hauled her body against his chest. Daring to meet his eyes, Emily swallowed the fear coating her throat as Dillon pegged her with a look telling her this torture wasnt over. With a rush of anger and adrenaline slicking through her nerves, she clawed at his face, digging her thumbnails into his eyes. Tiny slivers of blood streaked across Dillons lids as a howl of pain scraped from deep within his throat. Somewhere above the twisted havoc raking hard in her mind, Emily registered the sound of the front door swinging open, followed by Lisas screams. In a flurry of commotion, Michael rushed up behind Dillon, grabbing him under the arms. Michaels movements were frantic as he pulled Dillon from Emily. Both men stumbled, their limbs flailing in every direction. Michael landed on his back on the floor. Dillon fell on top of him. The loud thud echoed through the room. Michael tossed Dillon away, rolled to the side, and sprang to his feet. With Lisas arm curled tight around her shoulders, Emily shook uncontrollably, crying as she watched Dillon stagger up from the ground. Michael lunged, swung his fist, and caught Dillons mouth. The blow split his lip. I shouldve done this to you last night, asshole! Michael spewed. As Dillon righted himself, he stumbled forward, clenching Michaels collar. Before he could do anything, Michaels fist landed in a continuous assault against Dillons face, knocking him clear to the floor. A clatter of voices, including Olivias, rang in Emilys ears as nausea churned in her stomach. She stood frozen, her cries dying in her mouth, as she watched her apartment fill with concerned neighbors and, within a few minutes, a couple of New York City police officers. After a quick explanation from Michael, one of the cops dragged Dillon to his feet and cuffed his hands behind his back. Youre a fucking whore! Dillon wheezed, spitting a mouthful of blood in Emilys direction. Nothing but a fucking whore! I hope he fucks you and leaves you like all the rest, you cunt! Dillons poisonous words pressed into Emilys head in a violent explosion. She felt as if she were a tiny particle of dust moving in slow motion in the middle of a roaring tornado. Though insanity whirled around her in a room filled with people, she didnt see anything . . . but Gavins face. Though one of the cops threatened to make Dillons overnight stay a memorable one, she couldnt hear anything . . . just the thrumming of her broken heart. The only thing she could comprehend was the numbness flooding her veins. She freed herself from her sisters hold and made her way toward Dillon, who stood with a cocky smirk toying at his bloodied lip. Staring into the wicked soul of the man shed loved for so long, the man shed given all of herself to, and without a tear in her eye, she smacked him across the face. Unable to stop the pent-up anguish from the months of hell shed allowed him to put her through, pain erupted in her hands, down to their fragile bones, as she continued to beat her fists against his face and chest. You did this to me! she screamed, struggling against one of the officers. The officer pulled Emily back as she glared at Dillon. I loved you, and you became everything you said you never would! And you want to know something, Dillon? she asked, her breathing a ragged mess. With the smirk falling from his face, Dillon peered over his shoulder as an officer escorted him out of the apartment. If Gavin does leave me and never talks to me again, I deserve every second of misery Ill be in without him. Body shaking, Emily watched Dillon walk out of her life as quickly as hed walked into it. She wrapped her arms around her stomach, thoughts of Gavin splintering through her heart as she fell to her knees. With her last bit of strength, Emily backed herself against the coffee table, dropped her face into her hands, and began to cry violently. Lisa sat beside her, pulled her into her lap, and cradled her head against her shoulder. As Lisa rocked her back and forth, Emily realized shed saved herself from becoming another statistic.  Another silent voice.  Surprised shed let it get so far, visions of her mother accepting the same brutal treatment from not only her father but countless other men flashed through her memory. The haunting images chilled Emilys bones. Shh, Emily, Lisa whispered, holding her tighter. Its over now. Olivia knelt beside them, her voice soft. Are you okay? She handed Emily an ice pack and opened a first aid kit. Taking out a bandage, Olivia tore it open and placed her hand under Emilys chin. After securing a piece of gauze with medical tape over the fresh wound above Emilys brow, Olivia frowned. Eyes watery, Emily nodded. Yeah, Im all right. The remaining officer walked over to Emily, his overly round physique making his uniform look ill fitted. Miss, Im gonna need a statement from you. Paramedics should be here soon. Theyll take you to the hospital if you think you need to be seen. No. Emily brought the ice pack up to her swollen cheekbone. She flinched as it made contact with her skin. I dont want to go to the hospital. Thats fine, the officer replied, looking at a clipboard. You can refuse treatment when they get here, but they still need to show up because it was a domestic violence call. Michael sat on the ottoman, his expression piqued in question. Emily, I think you should go get checked out. I agree, Lisa said, concern brimming in her eyes. Emily rose, trying to rein in the discord fucking with her mind. She moved unsteadily across the living room to check if Gavin had called back. Lisa and Olivia scrambled to their feet and followed her into her room. Em, Olivia said. She lightly grabbed Emilys arm, confusion creasing her forehead. Why dont you want to go? Emily turned away and pushed her hands through her hair. She reached for her phone, her heart dipping when she saw she didnt have any missed calls from Gavin. I said no, Olivia. I dont need to go to the hospital. Tears gathered in her eyes as she slumped onto her bed. Im fine. I just need some aspirin and sleep. Olivias lips formed into a hard line. She looked over to Lisa, her expression showing equal worry. Lisa crossed her arms and leaned against the doorway. Emily, I swear, you can be so stubborn sometimes. I know, Emily whispered. But really, Im fine. Olivia lifted her head and exhaled toward the ceiling. Bringing her attention back to Emily, she placed a hand on her hip. You want to know the only reason why Im not going to push this issue further with you, friend? Emily pressed her eyes closed and shook her head. Why, Olivia? Well, that would be because you gave Duckleberry-Finn a pretty decent beat-down before his ass was hauled outta here. Emily lay back, rolled to her side, and hugged her knees to her chest. Normally, she wouldve found Olivias comment somewhat funny. But not now. She couldnt. It was all she could do to muster a reply. Right, Emily said, sadness clouding her voice. She brought the ice pack up to her cheek. Eyes steeped in pain from her discomfort, she stared at Olivia. I guess I did. Emily inhaled a deep breath, grabbed her blanket, and pulled it over her body. When the paramedics get here, send them in. But right now, I just need to rest. Though concern still showed on their faces, Olivia and Lisa nodded. Without another word, they walked out of the room. Over the next half hour, Emily filled out the necessary paperwork from the officer and refused treatment when the paramedics eventually showed up. Once the room became quiet and her thoughts finally started to settle, her eyes came to rest on her phone. Picking it up, she stared at it, her face paling when she saw it was void of any messages from Gavin. Tears streamed freely down her cheeks. Knowing she had to explain the hurt shed inflicted upon him, she dialed his number. She chewed at the inside of her lip as she listened to it ring. When his voice mail picked up, she went to close her phone but stopped. Worry plagued her, and an ache for him, so deep, tightened in her chest. Gavin . . . I . . . Its Emily, she whispered, trying not to trip over the emotions climbing up her throat. I dont expect you to talk to me ever again, but I need to say a few things. Taking a deep breath and exhaling slowly, she continued. Dillon diminished my sense of feeling alive, Gavin. But you . . . you brought that back to me. When Gina opened the door that morning, I . . . Emily paused, wiping away tears. I was scared you took her back, but I shouldve let you explain and I didnt. Im so sorry. Im sorry that out of any girl in this world you couldve fallen in love with, you chose me. Im sorry I didnt believe you when I shouldve, and it was me who broke your heart. I love you, Gavin. I know youre the one who said you thought you loved me from the moment you saw me, but I know I loved you from the moment I saw you. Something inside me told me I was supposed to be with you, but I fought against it. So many things about you scared me at first, and then you showed me who you really are. Unable to keep fighting the raw emotion weighing heavy on her heart, Emily broke out into hysterics. Please forgive me for fighting against us, Gavin. Please forgive me for not fighting for us when I knew we were supposed to be together. Forgive me for being the weak mess I am. But more than anything . . . thank you for loving me. Thank you for your dimpled smile and your bottle caps. Ill never be able to look at one without thinking of you. Thank you for your stupid Yankees and your wiseass remarks. Thank you for wanting late-night drives and sunset-watching with me. Thank you for wanting the good, the bad, and the in-between. Emily paused and shook her head, but before she could say another word, the voice mail cut her off, the long beep alerting her that her time was up. Im just sorry the only thing you got from me was the bad, she whispered, staring at the ceiling as she clenched her phone to her chest.

1476776075	description	You Were Mine    Tripp Eight years ago It wasnt just another summer. It was my last summer here in Rosemary Beach. I was already feeling the suffocating presence of my father and his plans for me. He was so sure Id leave for Yale in the fall. Id gotten in, thanks to his connections. Hed made me take a tour of the campus, and once I was in, hed forced me to accept. Nobody turns down Yale. It was all that ever came out of his mouth anymore. Yale this, Yale that. Goddamn Yale. I wanted to be on my Harley. I wanted another fucking tattoo. I wanted to feel the wind in my hair and know I had nowhere I had to be. That life was free. I was free. Before this summer was over, I was going to ride off without a word. Leave behind the money and power that came with being a Newark and find my path. This wasnt my world. I would never fit in here. Hey, sweetie, I didnt see you walk in, London Winchester said as she slipped her arms around one of mine and held on. That was another reason I had to get the fuck out of here. London. My mother was already planning our wedding. Didnt matter that Id broken up with her last month. London, her mother, and my mother all believed I was just going through a moody phase or something. My mother said it was OK if I needed to sow some wild oats this summer. London would be patient. Wheres Rush? I asked, glancing around the house full of people. If Rush Finlay was throwing parties again, then his mother and his younger sister, Nan, had to be out of town. Rush owned the place. His father was the drummer in the legendary rock band Slacker Demon. His mother and his sister benefited from all the money Rush had, thanks to his dad. Rushs mother had been a groupie once, and although Rushs dad, Dean Finlay, seemed to care about his kid, he didnt give a shit about Rushs mom. They had never married. Nan had another father, who was also out of the picture. Outside by the pool. Want me to take you to him? she asked sweetly. That sweet tone was so fucking fake it was ridiculous. The girl was venomous. Id seen her in action. I can find him, I replied, shaking her loose and walking away without a backward glance. Really? This is how youre going to be now? I wont wait around on you forever, Tripp Newark! she called out after me. Good, I said calmly over my shoulder, then headed into the crowd, hoping to get some people and some distance between us. Id been with her for two years. Shed been a really good fuck, and once I thought maybe she was it. But I could never actually say I was in love with her. This past year, I had realized I was simply tolerating her. I dreaded seeing her, and when I faced the facts, I realized I was keeping her around to make my parents happy. But I was done with that. No more keeping the parents happy. I was keeping me happy. Tripp! Woods Kerrington called out from a circle of girls surrounding him. He was such a fucking Romeo. He made them all believe they had a chance. Holding in a chuckle, I nodded my head in his direction. Whats up. Hopefully a lot of things real soon, he replied, and this time I laughed. Jace is outside with Rush and Grant if youre looking for him. Thanks. Jace was my younger cousin, and Woods was Jaces best friend. Id had them both in my life for as long as I could remember. Turning through the crowd, I headed for the back door. Stop it! I said no, Jonathon. Im not interested. I stopped in my tracks. That didnt sound good. I got you in here tonight, and Im not getting any thanks for it? The guy was angry and sounded like a prick. The girl didnt respond right away. I moved toward their voices and stopped outside the kitchen. I recognized the Jonathon guy the girl was talking to. He was a tennis instructor at Kerrington Country Club, which was owned by Woodss family. He was also a notorious asshole and had fucked most of the cougars in town. If he was about to take advantage of this girl, then I was going to throw his ass out. I just . . . I didnt know . . . I want to leave. The way the girls timid voice cracked told me she was scared. Fuck that, bitch. I dont care how damn hot your tits are. Im not dealing with this shit. You can find the door by yourself, Jonathon snarled. I took a step toward the door as Jonathon stalked through it. Stupid little fuck. I shoved him back into the kitchen with one hard push. He was going to apologize for being a dickhead before I threw him out. I doubted Rush even knew he was here. Jonathon wasnt in our circle of friends. Some of the cougars he had slept with included a couple of our mothers. Not on our favorites list. Getting his sorry ass to apologize would do him some good. Poor girl should have known better than to mess around with the help at the club. Maybe shed learn a lesson after this. What the fuck? he shouted, and then his eyes widened when he realized who I was. My dad sat on the board at the Kerrington Club, and I could have Jonathon fired with one word. He knew it. Thats what I was wondering, Jonathon. What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing at Finlays house, and why the fuck are you treating your date so badly? She too young for you? I know you prefer the over-forty crowd, I said, taunting him. I wanted him gone. Just one wrong move, and that was all I needed to make sure he lost his job without feeling a shred of remorse. I didnt . . . I mean, I was invited. I got an invite. This is just a girl whose aunt works at the club. Shes not anybody. Glancing over at the girl in question, I recognized her right away from her big brown eyes. She was Darlas niece, Bethy. Id seen her before. Hell, it was hard to miss her. Jonathon was right about her tits. They were noticeable. But her sweet face and innocent look had kept me from moving in on that. Besides, Darla was scary as hell. She handled hiring the employees at the club, and shed been there forever. Bethy, right? I asked her. Her big eyes got even bigger before she nodded. This guys a douchebag, sweetheart. You shouldnt trust him. Be careful who you let take you out. You know her? Jonathon asked incredulously, as if she were too beneath me to notice. Stupid shit was getting on my last nerve. I turned my attention back to him. Yeah. I know her aunt. The woman who hired your sorry ass. I wonder how shed feel if she knew how poorly you were treating her niece? Jonathons fear was obvious. He had a good gig at the club, and he didnt want to lose it. Leave. Dont ever come back. Finlay finds out about this, hell do more than give you a warning. Hell beat your sorry ass. He likes Darla. We all do. Stay the fuck away from her niece. Jonathon turned his attention to Bethy. The furious gleam in his eyes was directed at her. She shrank farther back, putting more distance between them until her back was pressed to the wall. Dickhead was getting off on scaring her. Stepping between the two of them, I glared at Jonathon. Leave. Now. I could tell it was taking everything he had to keep his mouth shut, but he did. I watched as he muttered a curse and turned to leave the kitchen. Make sure you dont stop until youre off this property, I called out after him. When he was gone, I turned back to Bethy. She was wringing her hands and looking nervous. Id gotten rid of the prick. Why was she upset now? You good now? I asked her. She bit her bottom lip, then shrugged. I, um, dont know. She didnt know? I couldnt keep from grinning. She was pretty damn cute. But she was young. Why dont you know? I asked. I enjoyed the way she talked. Her voice was husky but sweet. She let out a small sigh and dropped her gaze to the floor. He was my ride. I dont live close by. As if I would let her get back into the car with that fucker. He had to be four years older than her. He was older than me. Ill give you a ride. Im safe. Jonathon isnt. Besides, hes way too old for you. Dude would go to jail if he touched you. She lifted her eyes back up to look at me. Im almost seventeen, she said, as if that were legal, although she was a little older than I expected. She was so expressive. I liked that. She didnt try to bat her eyelashes or pucker her lips to look sexy. She was real. How long had it been since Id been with a girl who was real? But then, she was young, and shed been raised in a very different world from mine. Yeah, sweetheart. But hes almost twenty. He shouldnt have gone anywhere near you. She looked deflated, then nodded. Surely she hadnt wanted to stay with him? Fuck that, what was Darla teaching this girl? Im sorry I ran him off, but he wasnt treating you right. Those eyes went wide again, and a dimple appeared in her cheek. Oh, dont apologize for that. He wanted me to go back to a bedroom and uh . . . She trailed off. She didnt need to explain. I was pretty sure of what he wanted to do back in a bedroom with her. Come on. Lets get you home, I said, nodding toward the door.|You Were Mine    Prologue Tripp Everyone has that defining moment in life. That one choice you have to make. I had my moment, and it has haunted me ever since. In those defining moments, you either pave a road to happiness or you regret every step from then on. For me, I dont know which road would have been the best, because between my two choices, neither of them included her. I was young and so fucking scared. Scared of being forced by my parents to be someone I didnt want to be. Scared of making the wrong choice. Scared of leaving her. But mostly, I was scared of losing her. She was my regret. Leaving her changed me. The moment I climbed onto my bike and drove out of Rosemary Beach, Florida, I left true joy behind. Id only had that summer with her, three months that altered me forever. But what I would never be able to forgive myself for was that they had changed her just as much. She was beyond broken now. I couldnt reach her. Seeing her in pain broke my soul. Losing my cousin Jace had caused deep pain in both of us, something I never wanted to relive. He would forever be in my heart. Id never forget his laugh and the easy way he loved and lived his life. He didnt live in the world of fear I inhabited. He chose his path, and he walked it. He was the better man. And I had been able to stand back and let him have her. She deserved the better man. Now he was gone, and both of our worlds were thrown off-balance. Because I couldnt stand back anymore. No one was protecting her. No one was holding her, but she wouldnt fucking let me near her. She wasnt going to let me fix the past. Id severed any hope of that when Id driven away and left her with no other choice but to be with Jace. If only I could embrace the emptiness and accept it. But I couldnt. Not when I saw her lost, beautiful face. She needed me as much as I needed her. Our story wasnt over. It would never be over. If I had to stay here and watch over her, even though she wouldnt let me get near her, I would. For the rest of my motherfucking life. Id stay right here. Making sure my Bethy was OK.

Lauren has mastered writing delectable heroes and strong-willed heroines to match, and the contrast between the rough-edged Finn and polished Harlow makes for a passionate romance."" (RT Book Reviews)The pseudonymous writing duo behind Beautiful Bastard (2013) continues the Wild Seasons series with a sequel that is both dirty and rowdy. When a friend's comic-book store opening brings Finn to Harlow's neighborhood, they can't deny their lingering feelings for long […] In addition to casual sex, the two distract themselves from more serious life issues with authentic regional fun involving comic books and craft beers with their friends, who make for hilarious secondary characters. Fans will appreciate that Mia and Ansel, who were the focus of Book 1 [Sweet Filthy Boy], are still together when they all meet up at the grand opening. In a story that is easily devoured in one sitting, the details are sparse but spot-on—""Apparently there are a lot of nerds in San Diego,"" notes Finn—and witty dialogue carries the plot swiftly to a happy ending.

148142081X	description	Hold on Tight  Chapter One Six years later . . . SIENNA I never expected to step foot in Sea Breeze, Alabama, again. When my parents had packed my bags and shipped me off to live in Fort Worth, Texas, with my mom’s sister, who I hardly knew, I had been told I would return to Sea Breeze after the baby was born. What I hadn’t been told was that they weren’t planning on my baby returning with me. I glanced back at Micah, asleep in his car seat with his Darth Vader action figure clenched tightly in his hand. Our life hadn’t been easy, but we had each other. I wouldn’t go back and do it any other way. Micah was my life. He had healed me when I was sure nothing ever could. Keeping Micah meant being disowned by my strict religious parents. My aunt wasn’t the most affectionate person in the world, but she’d disagreed with my parents’ decision. I had been expected to work and pay my own way, but at least she’d given us a roof over our heads. Giving up on high school and getting my GED was my only option. My aunt Cathy was the principal at the local high school and helped me get a trade school grant, so when Micah was eighteen months old, I enrolled in beauty school. Before his third birthday I had a degree in cosmetology. I owed my aunt more than I could ever repay her. Micah and I moved out just last year and finally got an apartment of our own. I didn’t date because I didn’t trust anyone around my son. I also felt guilty paying for a sitter when we needed that money for more important things, like rent, day care, and food. It didn’t keep men from flirting, though, and trying to get me to go out with them. Janell, the owner of the salon where I worked, said that the men all thought I was playing hard to get. It just made them more persistent. The truth was, I was lonely sometimes, but then Micah would smile and I’d see his father in him and I’d remember that for ten years of my life I’d had someone. A very special someone. And now I had Micah. I didn’t need anything more. When the call had come two months ago from my mother to tell me about my father’s heart attack, I hadn’t known what to feel. He had never met Micah, and now he never would. My mother had used Dad’s life insurance money to move to a retirement community in central Florida. She’d given her house to Micah and me. Not one time did she apologize for deserting me when I’d needed her most, or for turning her back on her only grandchild. But the fact that she had given the house to us meant something. I only hoped one day she would realize what she was missing by not knowing him. Janell had helped me by giving me a glowing reference, and I had managed to get a job in Sea Breeze working at one of the most elite salons in town. I would be making more money, and I wouldn’t be paying rent any longer. Our life would be better in Sea Breeze. Micah would get to grow up in the small coastal town that I loved. My only fear, and the one reason I almost didn’t come back home, was the idea of the Falcos seeing Micah. Once I’d realized that my parents hadn’t been planning on me keeping my son, I sent a letter to Tabby Falco, Dustin’s mother. She never replied. The first year of Micah’s life I wrote them countless letters and included pictures of him. He looked so much like his father. I wanted them to see that Dustin wasn’t completely lost to us. He had left a part of himself behind. Not once did she respond. A few times I’d almost worked up the nerve to call them, but if they weren’t replying to my letters, then they didn’t want to talk to me. They didn’t want Micah. It had hurt even worse than my parents not wanting him. I had hated the Falcos for their desertion. But then I’d learned to let go. Move on. Be happy with my life. With my beautiful little boy. “Momma? Where are we?” a sleepy little voice asked from the backseat of my twelve-year-old Honda Civic. “We’re home. Our new home,” I replied, pulling into the driveway of the house that had once been my home and would soon be again. “Our new house?” he asked with excitement in his voice as he wiggled in his seat to see better. “Yep, baby. Our new house. Ready to go inside and see it?” I asked him, opening my car door and getting out. It was a two-door, so I had to lean my seat forward to reach him in the backseat. He unbuckled himself, then scrambled out of his seat and jumped out of the car. “Do other people live in there too?” he asked, staring up at the two-bedroom wood-frame house with wide eyes. “Just us, kiddo. You’ll have your own bedroom here. Mine is right across the hall from yours.” “Whoa,” he said, his eyes shining with amazement. Even when we had lived with my aunt Cathy, Micah and I had shared a room. Once we’d moved into an apartment, a studio was all I could afford with day care costs. This house was only twelve hundred square feet, but it was the biggest living space he and I had ever had all to ourselves. The studio apartment had been a third of this size. “Let’s go see your new room. We might need to paint it. Not sure what color the walls are,” I told him. The last time I’d been in my old bedroom, it had been pink. Micah was determined that pink was for girls and wanted nothing to do with it. From my purse I pulled out the key that my mother had mailed me along with the letter and the deed to the house. I took a deep breath before unlocking the door. Stepping back, I motioned for Micah to go inside. “Check it out.” His grin spread across his face as he took off running into the house, whooping as he saw the size of the living room. Then he turned and headed down the short hallway. I paused at the door, unable to ignore the house across the street any longer, and turned around to look at it. I didn’t recognize the truck in the driveway, but then again, it had been six years. I was sure the Falcos were still there. Mother hadn’t mentioned that they’d moved. I wondered if they would speak to Micah when he played in the yard. Or would they ignore him like they had since his birth? I wouldn’t tell him who they were. I hadn’t told him about my parents. He didn’t know this had once been my home. He didn’t know he had grandparents. In preschool he had been asked to tell the class about his grandparents, and when he’d told them about Aunt Cathy, he had called her Aunt Cathy. The kids in his class had teased him, telling him that his aunt wasn’t his grandparent. He’d come home confused and upset that he didn’t know who his grandparents were. I had just told him he didn’t have any. When he’d asked about his father, I had explained that God had wanted his father because he was such an awesome man, so he had brought him to heaven to live there with him before Micah was born. That had been enough for Micah. He hadn’t asked any more questions. He was happy with the knowledge that his mother loved him unconditionally and that we were a family. It had been hard for him when he saw that other kids had large families, but once he’d understood that each family was different, he was okay with that. “Momma! Momma!” Micah called out in excitement. “There’s a blue room. It’s a really cool blue room too! It’s even got toys in it already!” Toys? I closed the front door behind me and headed down the hall. Stepping into the bedroom that had once been mine, I stopped and looked around me in awe. It was blue. A bright, happy blue. It had a full-size bed and a matching wooden dresser. There was a blue quilt on the bed with orange basketballs all over it, and in the center sat a basketball-shaped pillow. A toy box under the window was open, with pirate swords, a baseball bat and glove, a large red fire truck, and what looked like a big bag of Legos sticking out of it. An indoor basketball hoop sat in the opposite corner, with a ball lying on the floor beside it. Above his bed was painted MICAH. “Do you think the people who used to live here left it for me? Or do we gotta give it back?” he asked, a hopeful expression on his face. “And look, Momma, my name is already on the wall.” Tears stung my eyes, and I had to swallow hard as I stood there taking in the room. I didn’t know what to think. This was not what I had expected, but then again, I hadn’t expected to be given this house, either. A white envelope caught my attention. It was leaning against the wall on top of the dresser, with my name and Micah’s name written on it. Walking over to it, I wiped at the tear that had escaped, and I tried to hide my face from my very observant five-year-old. The envelope was sealed, so I slid my finger underneath and opened it up. Sienna, This is your home now. It doesn’t make up for the past or for the years I wasn’t there when you needed me. But it is all I have to give you. I don’t expect to buy your forgiveness. This room is as much for me as it is for Micah. I’ve always wanted to buy him things. Christmas presents and birthday presents and gifts just because he is my grandson. I couldn’t do that, though. Not while I lived with your father. I won’t speak ill of your father—that is not what this is about. I loved him. He was a good man, but he was a proud man and I had to respect that. I believe in my heart that if he had it to do over, he would have done things differently. I hate that he never got to meet our grandson. Please tell Micah that the room is his with love from someone who hopes she can meet him one day. When you are ready, of course. If you are ever ready. I just ask that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I want to be a part of your lives. My address and phone number are listed below. If you want to send me a letter or give me a call, I would love that. Or maybe send me some photos of Micah. I have a photo album full thanks to your aunt Cathy. He’s a beautiful one, but then, so is his mother. Love always, Mom “Momma, why’re you crying?” Micah asked as he tugged on the bottom of my shorts. I folded the letter and tucked it in my back pocket before bending down and looking at him. He reached out and wiped my face with his little hands. “It’s okay if we can’t stay here. Just so I’m with you,” he said. The sadness in his eyes hurt my heart. This house was too good for him to believe. I grabbed his hands and squeezed them tightly. “This is our home. The person who gave it to us did all this just for you. These are happy tears, not sad ones,” I told him. I wasn’t ready to explain about his grandmother. I didn’t know how I felt about introducing him to her. There was too much pain for me to deal with right now. But her words and this room meant a lot. It didn’t make up for her abandonment, but knowing she loved Micah enough to do this did help me consider letting her into our life. “So I get to keep this? All of it?” he asked, looking around at the room again, his eyes wide with wonder. We had even shared a bed up until now. “Yes. All of this is yours. Just yours. You have your own space now. Your own bed. Even your own closet.” Micah walked over to his bed and ran his little hand over the quilt. He knew what a basketball was. I had bought him one with my first paycheck. It was a part of his father I wanted him to have. “Did the person who did this for me know my daddy was the best basketball player in the world?” he asked, glancing back at me. I nodded, biting back a smile. “We’re gonna be happy here, Momma,” he said, then turned to go back to his toy box. I watched him for a few minutes I watched him as he dug through the things my mother had left him. Then I slipped out of the room to check out the rest of the house. In the letter she’d sent with the house key and the deed, she’d told me she was leaving the furniture behind. The place where she was living now was furnished. I wasn’t sure how I felt about sleeping on my parents’ bed, but all I’d had was a mattress, and we’d left that behind in Texas. Opening the door to the master bedroom, I froze before relief washed over me. It was my old bed, dresser, and vanity. Even my old desk. She had moved it all into here, knowing I wouldn’t want their things. The quilt on the bed was the same one that had been on my bed when I’d left six years ago. It was pale pink with big daisies all over it. I was home. Present day . . . DEWAYNE I pulled my truck into my parents’ driveway and parked beside my dad’s truck. Normally, I tried to come over and visit once a week. The past two weeks, however, I just hadn’t been in the mood. Momma had broken down and cried the last time I was here, reminding us all that it was the six-year anniversary of my little brother’s death. The only way I knew how to deal with that was to get my ass drunk every damn night until I was numb again. Until I was past the pain, and the empty space in my chest didn’t ache so damn bad. After managing to stay sober for the past two nights, I decided I had better get back over here to see my momma before she came looking for me. That woman had a temper on her, and I didn’t need her coming after me. I wasn’t scared of much, but Tabby Falco was someone I feared. Loved all five feet three inches of her, but I was terrified of her. Glancing across the street, I noticed a beat-up white Honda Civic. It had seen better days. Nina Roy had moved out about a month ago, just a few weeks after her husband’s death. Momma said she’d gone to Florida. The place had sat empty for the past month. Was someone moving in? If so, that car didn’t make it look like it was the good kind of neighbors. I might have to stop by and make sure my parents were safe. They didn’t need to be dealing with wild parties or a meth house from some trashy new neighbors. I took a step closer and checked out the license plate. Texas. Now I was as curious as I was concerned. Who the hell did Nina Roy sell her house to? I never even saw a For Sale sign in the yard. If she’d rented it, we might really have a problem. Just last week three rented houses just an hour north of here were busted for meth. “What you gawking at our new neighbor’s car for? Get in here and see your momma!” I turned to see my dad standing at the door with it wide open, an annoyed look on his face. Once upon a time I wouldn’t have felt the need to protect the man. I wouldn’t have thought anything could touch him. But then he’d had the stroke. Things had changed. I had officially taken over my dad’s construction company, Falco Construction. Dad just couldn’t handle it anymore. He had always seemed larger than life, but nothing had been the same since Dustin’s death. “You met them?” I asked him, nodding toward the house across the street. He shook his head. “Car showed up. Haven’t seen who was in it. No moving van or U-Haul. Just the car. Sometime around noon yesterday. Car was gone at two today when I glanced outside, but then it was back when I went to water the flowers at four.” This was just getting worse. Someone had moved in without stuff. This wasn’t the best subdivision in Sea Breeze, but so far it had been safe from things like meth houses. I wasn’t about to let that shit find its way into my parents’ neighborhood. “I’ll be right back,” I told him, and started across the street before he could stop me. Not that he could stop me. “Get back over here, boy,” he called, but I held a hand up. “Just a sec. I need to check this out,” I replied, and kept my eyes focused on the door and the windows. I didn’t want to spook whoever was inside and end up getting shot if they were in there setting up shop. Nina Roy should’ve thought about who she was letting move into this place. But then, I wasn’t sure that woman had much of a heart, anyway. Her daughter had been shipped off shortly after my brother’s death, never to return. They’d been best friends for most of their lives, and it had progressed to the relationship stage. Word was, sweet little Sienna had suffered a mental breakdown and they had sent her off to a facility. No one had ever seen her again. It wasn’t easy for me to accept for a long time. Much as I hated to admit it, I’d taken her leaving harder than I should have. Especially knowing what Dustin’s death had done to her. That was one more thing to add to my list of fuckups. I knocked on the door and waited. I kept my eyes on the doorknob in case it slowly turned. If the fucker had a gun, I was ready to disarm him. Before I could think about just how I would do that, the door swung open and a pair of brown eyes were looking up at me with keen interest. “Hi,” the little boy said, staring at me as if he wasn’t sure he had done the right thing by opening the door. This was not what I had been expecting. I hadn’t imagined a family had moved in across the street, not from the looks of that vehicle. It didn’t look like a family car—it wasn’t safe for adults, much less kids. “Hi, your folks home?” I asked him, and he stared at me a moment longer before frowning. “I don’t have folks. I have a momma, but she’s in the bathroom. She had to go pee. I probably shouldn’t have answered the door.” The kid was cute. And he was right. He didn’t need to be opening the door. And giving a complete stranger that kind of information. If he had just a mother, then the car in the driveway concerned me for other reasons. If that was all she had, how the hell had she afforded this house? It wasn’t an expensive house or anything, but I’d think a used rental trailer would have been more in her price range. “Maybe in the future you should wait for her to open the door. You got lucky this time.” I pointed at my parents’ house. My dad was standing on the front porch watching us. “That’s my parents’ house. I was coming to meet the new neighbors.” The kid peeked around my legs and looked at the house and my dad, then turned his attention back to me. “You live with your parents? My momma ain’t got no parents.” Again, more info than he needed to be sharing. Hell, did this woman not teach her kid not to talk to strangers and spill her life story? It wasn’t safe. “Probably shouldn’t tell strangers that, either, little man,” I told him. He frowned and held out his hand as if to shake mine. “My name is Micah. What’s yours?” Although he shouldn’t have been telling me his name, I couldn’t help but grin. The kid was a charmer. I clasped his hand in mine and gave it a shake. “Nice to meet you, Micah. My name’s Dewayne.” His grin got huge. “Like Dwyane Wade? You know, from the Miami Heat?” I didn’t keep up with basketball much, but I knew who Dwyane Wade was. I nodded. “I wish I had a name that cool. But I would want to be named LeBron.” “I take it you’re a Heat fan,” I said. He nodded vigorously. “Oh yeah. I’ll be the best one day. My dad was the world’s best basketball player. I will be too.” I thought he’d said he didn’t have a dad. Just a mom. “Micah?” a soft, feminine voice called. The kid’s eyes got big and he spun around. “Yeah, Momma. I’m at the door with our neighbor. He came to visit.” I lifted my eyes from the kid just in time to see legs. Lots of fucking legs, all smooth and creamy and encased in tiny little cutoff blue jean shorts. Holy hell. My eyes continued their upward track, taking in the tiny waist and generous breasts barely covered up by a tank top before reaching her face. Mary, Mother of Jesus. No. Fucking. Way. I knew that face. It was older. She was a woman now, but I knew that face. Those bright blue eyes, all that long, silky red hair, and those pink lips that made men, young and old, fantasize. But this . . . She couldn’t—I stopped and stepped back, and then my eyes went back to the boy in front of me. “Micah, go to your room,” she said in a calm, even voice. “Now. Go.” “But he’s nice—” the little boy started, but she cut him off. “Micah, go.” I watched the back of his head as he walked away from me. I wanted to see his face again. I wanted to study it.

1501125710	description	Maybe Not    Chapter One Im convinced that hell has an intercom system and the buzz of my alarm clock is played at full volume on repeat against the screams of all the lost souls. Which is why Ill never murder anyone, because theres no way I can live with this sound for eternity. I cant even live with it for five seconds. I reach over and stop the alarm, dreading another day at work. I hate that I have to keep this shitty barista job just to pay for school. At least Ridge lets my sporadic rent checks slide in exchange for my managing his band. It works for now, but God, I hate mornings. I stretch my arms, bring my hands to my eyes, and begin rubbing the sleep out of them. When my fingers meet my eyes, for a split second I think maybe my worst fears have come true and Im actually burning in hell, because SHIT! Motherfucker! Im going to kill him! Ridge! I scream. Oh, God. It burns. I stand up and attempt to open my eyes, but theyre stinging too badly for them to be of any use. Its the oldest prank in the book, and I cant believe I fell for it. Again. I cant find my shortsGod it hurts so badso I stumble my way to the bathroom in order to wash the pepper juice from my eyes and hands. I find the doorknob and swing the door open, rushing straight to the sink. Im pretty sure I hear a girl screaming, but that very well could be me screaming. I cup my hands beneath the stream of water and bring them up to my eyes, rinsing them over and over until the burn starts to subside. Once my eyes begin to feel relief, my shoulder starts to ache from the repeated blows being delivered to it. Get out, you pervert! Im awake enough now to know that I actually did hear a girl screaming, and now that girl is hitting me. In my bathroom.  I grab a hand towel and press it to my eyes while I shield her punches with my elbow. I was peeing, you sick bastard! Get out! Shit, she hits hard. I still cant really see her, but I can recognize fists when theyre flying at me. I grab both of her wrists to keep her from assaulting me even more. Stop hitting me! I yell. The bathroom door that leads to the living room swings open and my left eye is working enough that I can tell Brennan is standing there. What the hell is going on? He walks toward us and removes my hands from her wrists and then stands between us. I bring the towel back to my eyes and squeeze them shut. He barged in on me while I was peeing! the girl yells. And hes naked! I open one eye and glance down. I am, in fact, completely naked. Jesus, Warren. Put on some clothes, Brennan says. How was I supposed to know Id be attacked in my own bathroom? I say, pointing at her. Why the hell is she using my bathroom, anyway? Your guests can use your bathroom. Brennan immediately holds up two defensive palms. She didnt spend the night with me. Gross, the girl mutters. I dont know why Ridge thought it would be a good idea to rent a four-bedroom apartment. Even though one of the bedrooms is empty, thats still two people too many. Especially when guests spend the night and dont know about the designated bathrooms. Look, I say, pushing both of them toward the door that leads to the living room. This is my bathroom and Id like to use it. I dont care where she slept or who she slept with; she can use your bathroom. This ones mine. Brennan holds up a finger and turns to face me. Actually, he says. This is a shared bathroom. With that bedroom. He points to the door that leads to the other bedroom. And that bedroom now belongs to . . . He points to the girl. Bridgette. Your new roommate. I pause. Why did he just call her my roommate? What do you mean, roommate? No one asked me if I wanted a new roommate. Brennan shrugs. You rarely pay rent, Warren. You dont really have a say in who lives here. He knows I dont pay rent because I help manage their band, but Ridge does take on the brunt of the financial expenses. He makes a good point, unfortunately. This isnt good. I cant share a bathroom with a girl. Especially a girl with that good of an arm. And especially a girl with all that bronzed skin. I look away from her. I hate that shes hot. I hate that shes a brunette, because I really like her long, light brown hair and the way its pulled back, all messy and shit. Dammit! Well, this has been a really fun bonding moment, Bridgette says, walking toward me. She shoves my shoulders, pushing me back toward my bedroom. Now wait your turn, Roomie. The bathroom door closes in my face and Im standing in my room again. Still naked. And maybe a little emasculated. You can leave, too, I hear her say to Brennan, right before the door to the living room slams shut. Seconds later, the water begins running in the shower. Shes in the shower. My shower. Shes probably taking off her shirt right now, tossing it on the floor, pulling her panties down over her hips. Im fucked.  My apartment is my sanctuary. My man cave. The only place I can go where my life isnt ruled by women. My boss is a woman, all my professors are women, my sister and my mother are both women. Once Bridgette steps into my shower and makes it her own with all her girly shampoos and razors and shit, Im screwed. Thats my shower. I walk to Ridges bedroom and flip the light switch a couple of times to give him warning that Im coming in, since hes deaf and cant hear me knocking or stomping toward his room like a kid about to tattle on his little brother. I flip the switch two more times and then swing his door open. Hes lifting up onto his elbows, groggy-eyed. He sees the anger on my face and he begins to laugh, incorrectly assuming Im here about the pepper-juice prank. I hate that I fell for it. Im such a deep sleeper though, and he gets me every damn time. That prank was stupid, I sign to him. But Im not here because of that. We need to talk. He sits up in bed and reaches over to tilt his alarm clock so that he can check the time. He looks back at me, agitated. Its six-thirty in the morning, he signs. What the hell do you want to talk about at six-thirty in the morning? I point in the direction of the new roommates bedroom. Bridgette. I hate her name. You let a girl move in? I make the sign for roommate and continue. Why in the world would you let a girl move in with us? Ridge makes the sign for Brennans name. Thats all him. I dont think he would have accepted no for an answer. I laugh. Since when are girls important to Brennan? I heard that, Brennan says from behind me. And saw you sign it. I face him. Good. So answer the question. He glares at me and then looks at Ridge. Go back to sleep. Ill handle the five-year-old. He motions for me to follow him into the living room, turning out Ridges bedroom light as he exits. I like Brennan, but the fact that weve known each other for so long makes me feel like hes my little brother sometimes. My annoying-as-fuck little brother. My little brother who thinks moving his women into our apartment is a good idea. Its just for a few months, Brennan says, continuing toward the kitchen. Shes in a rough spot and needs a place to stay. I follow Brennan into the kitchen. Since when did you start providing rescue homes? You dont even let girls spend the night when youre done with them, much less move in with you. Are you in love with her or something? Because if thats the case, this is the stupidest decision youve ever made. Youll get tired of her in a week and then what? Brennan faces me and calmly holds up a finger. I told you earlier, its not like that. We arent together and we never will be together. But shes important to me and shes in a tough spot and were going to help her, okay? He takes a bottle of water out of the fridge and opens the cap. It wont be that bad. Shes in school and works full-time, so shell hardly ever be here. You wont even notice. I groan, frustrated, and run my hands down my face. This is great, I mumble. The last thing I need right now is some chick taking over my entire bathroom. Brennan rolls his eyes and begins walking back toward his bedroom. Its a bathroom, Warren. Youre acting like a little shit. She hit me! I say in defense. Brennan turns and cocks an eyebrow. See what I mean? He walks into his bedroom and closes the door behind him. The water turns off in the shower, and I hear the curtain slide open. As soon as the door to her bedroom shuts, I walk toward the bathroom. My bathroom. I try to open the door from the living room, but its locked from the inside. I walk through my bedroom and check that door, but its locked, too. I walk out of my room, straight into her bedroom. My eyes catch a glimpse of her before she screams and pulls a towel in front of her. What the hell are you doing? She picks up a shoe and tosses it at me. It hits me in the shoulder, but I dont even flinch. I ignore her and walk into the bathroom and slam the door shut. I lean against it, lock it behind me, and then close my eyes. Dammit, shes hot. Why does she have to be hot? And I know it was just a glimpse but . . . she shaves. Everywhere. Its bad enough I have to share a bathroom with a girl, but now I have to share it with a hot girl? A hot girl who has a severe mean streak? A hot girl with a sick tan and hair so long and thick, it covers up her breasts when its wet, and shit, shit, shit. I hate Brennan. I hate Ridge. I also love them for doing this to me. Maybe having her for a roommate could be a good thing. Hey, asshole! she yells through the door. I used all the hot water. Have fun. Maybe not. I walk to Brennans room and swing open the door. Hes packing a suitcase and doesnt even look at me when I stalk over to him. What now? he asks, annoyed. I need to ask you something and I need you to be completely honest with me. He sighs and turns to face me. What is it? Have you slept with her? He looks at me like Im an idiot. I already told you no. I hate that hes acting so mature and calm about this situation, because my reaction is making me feel really immature. Brennan has always been the immature one. Since the moment I met Ridge . . . God how long ago was that? Ten years? Im twenty-four, Brennans twenty-one . . . yeah. Ten years. Ive been best friends with them for a decade, and this is the first time Ive actually felt inferior to Brennan. I dont like it. Im the responsible one. Well, not as responsible as Ridge, obviously, but no one is. I do manage Brennans band, and I do a hell of a good job of it, so why cant I seem to control my reactions right now? Because. I know myself, and if I cant get rid of the new roommate right away, then Ill more than likely become infatuated with her. And if Ill be infatuated with her, I need to make sure Brennan isnt. You have to be honest with me, because I think you might be in love with her and I need you to tell me youre not, because I think I might want to kiss her. And touch her. A lot. Like, everywhere. Brennans hands fly to his forehead and he looks at me like Ive lost my mind. He takes several steps back. Are you listening to yourself, Warren? I mean, fuck, man! You yell at me three minutes ago because you hate her and dont want her here, and now youre saying you want her? Are you bipolar? He makes a good point. Jesus, whats wrong with me? I pace the room, trying to figure out a solution. She cant stay here. But I want her to stay. I cant share a bathroom with her, but I dont really want anyone else to share a bathroom with her, either. Im a little bit selfish, apparently. I pause my frantic pacing and look at Brennan. Why is she so mean? Brennan walks over to me and calmly places two hands on my shoulders. Warren Russell, you need to calm the hell down. Youre starting to freak me out. I shake my head. I know. Im sorry, I just. I dont want to be attracted to a girl that youre involved with, so I need to know now if thats the case because we go too far back to let something like this mess us up. But you also know you cant just drop a girl that looks like her in my lap, and expect me not to go there in my head. And I just saw her naked and now Im useless. Ruined. Shes so damn perfect beneath all those clothes and . . . I look up at him. I just want to make sure Im not stepping on any toes when I fantasize about her tonight. Brennan stares at me, mulling over my admission. He pats me twice on the shoulder and returns to his suitcase. Shes mean, Warren. Probably the meanest girl Ive ever met in my life. So if she murders you in your sleep, dont say I didnt warn you. He closes his suitcase and begins to zip it. She needed a place to stay and we have an extra room. Her life makes mine and Ridges look like a cakewalk, so go easy on her. I take a seat on the edge of his bed. Im trying to be sympathetic to the situation, but the business manager in me is skeptical. She just called you out of the blue and asked if she could move in with you? Dont you think thats a little suspicious, Brennan? You dont think it has to do with the band finally making a name for itself? Brennan glares at me. Shes not an opportunist, Warren. Trust me on that. And hit on her if you want, I couldnt care less. He walks toward the door and grabs his keys off the dresser. Ill be back next week after the last show. Do you have our hotel rooms squared up? I nod. I emailed you all the confirmation numbers. Thanks, he says as he walks out of the room. I fall back onto the bed and hate the fact that Brennan isnt into her. That means shes fair game. I was kind of hoping she wasnt. But then I smile, because she is.

1512273996	description	" ""This book had everything that you could possibly think of and want. It had darkness, oh did it ever. It had pain, the pain that they both endured to get to be together was unfathomable. It had sorrow and loss, both of them trying to survive. But most of all it had love, a love that was gritty, it was dirty, it was semi-sweet, it was a love that will last a lifetime. A love you strive to get. A love that makes you whole even when there are pieces are missing. That book was brilliant!""  - Natasha, Three Chicks  ""Warning: Some seriously f*cked up shit happens in this story, not for the faint of heart.""- Sabrina, Goodreads Reviewer""While King was dark, Tyrant is WAY darker. But so engrossing! My heart was in my chest, I was emotional, I was on the edge of my seat. Secrets are revealed, the lies come out. Who do you trust?""- Ana's Attic Book Blog ""TYRANT is very fast-paced and gives all the answers that you're left wanting at the end of KING. True to the nature of this story, it's dark, gritty, and action-packed."" - Aestas Book Blog  ""So, why do I love it? This book is different than anything I have read. Yes, I read books about mob guys and bad guys all the time, but this book was BETTER. King is not a good guy who does bad things. He is a BAD GUY who happens to have a soft spot for a girl."" - Samantha, The Book Disciple  ""I had my theories about where T.M. Frazier would take this story of King and Pup, but I was wrong! She surprised me with all of her twists and turns and the layered stories within the story. I loved every minute. This is way more than a good girl meets a bad boy. This story is about love, acceptance, friendship, and the true meaning of family. I HIGHLY recommend both King and Tyrant to anyone who wants to be lost for hours a hot and sexy love story that will keep you guessing until the final page!"" - Aleatha Romig"

1626818800	description	"""Engaging, sexy, and noteworthy, Shuttergirl is just another example of why CD Reiss is one of my go to authors. Her clean writing style, flawed but relatable characters, and well-crafted story make this book one that's hard to put down even after you read the last page."" Kristy Bromberg, bestselling author of the Driven Trilogy""I went into Shuttergirl not knowing what magic CD Reiss had created. Instantly, I was swept away with perfect prose, incredible imagery, and a character connection I loved. In my mind, it was a perfect modern day fairy-tale where the loved and hated try to bridge the chasm of society's unwritten laws and listen to what they want, rather than what Hollywood tells them. It's the shit. Buy it."" Pepper Winters, bestelling author of the Monsters in the Dark series""Rich with tenderness, romance and witI loved everything about it."" Mia Sheridan, NY Times bestselling author of Archer's Voice""Forbidden yet sweet. Shuttergirl will make you believe that love has the power to break down all barriers. CD Reiss shows us her sweet side, but still manages to keep things sexy as hell."" Claire Conteras, author of There Is No Light In Darkness""Tender romance, smart writing. A total winner. Smart and romantic with characters you will root for until the end. I'm already looking forward to reading this book again. A story rich with tenderness and romance, written with the intelligence and wit that is all CD Reiss. I loved everything about Shuttergirl!"" Mia Sheridan, bestselling author of the Sign of Love series""A confident, badass heroine and a swoon worthy, good guy find each other in CD Reiss's latest contemporary romance. It's a Hollywood affair with more colors of reality than fairytale, depicting an honest and endearing paparazzi meets movie star relationship that captures all the swoon and flutters of the best love stories. With strikingly beautiful prose and the contrasting gritty, vivid Los Angeles setting, Shuttergirl is Reiss's finest work yet."" Laurelin Paige, author of the bestselling Fixed Trilogy"

Born in New York City, she moved to Hollywood, California to get her master's degree in screenwriting from USC. In case you want to know, that went nowhere, but it gave her a big enough ego to try her hand at novels. Shell tell you all about it out back, where a cord of wood awaits.

1682304566	title	Paper Princess: A Novel (The Royals)
1682304566	description	Ella, youre wanted in the principals office, Ms. Weir says before I can step inside the Precalculus classroom. I check my watch. Im not even late. Its one minute before nine and this watch is never wrong. Its probably the most expensive item I own. My mom said that it was my dads. Besides his sperm, its the only thing he left behind. No, its not about tardinessthis time. Her normally flinty gaze is soft around the edges, and my gut relays a warning to my sluggish morning brain. Ms. Weir is a hard ass, which is why I like her. She treats her students like were here to learn about actual math instead of some life lesson on loving your neighbor and crap like that. So for her to be giving me sympathetic looks means something bad is cooking down at the principals office. She should save her sympathy for Justin Slade, the captain of the football team, who is unironically sticking his tongue between his fingers and waggling the wormlike thing at me. He bragged about his tongue the day wed met, when he cornered me in the hallway, informed me I was hot, and graciously offered to give me the best sex of my life. Id said thanks, but no thanks. Since then hes been hounding me to reconsider, but it doesnt matter, because I wont have to deal with him for much longer. Hes going to college next year and will be in for a sore surprise when he realizes the best days of his life were in high school. His pathetic attempt at mocking me doesnt deserve acknowledgement. Fine. Its not like I can give any other response. I offer a nod and redirect myself to the school office. Ill email you the course assignment, Ms. Weir calls after me. Again with the sympathy. I should be worried. The implication behind her statement is that I wont be returning to class, but theres nothing Principal Thompson has to say that could faze me. Before enrolling in George Washington High School for my junior year, I had already lost everything of importance. There isnt anything else anyone can take from me. Even if Mr. Thompson has somehow found out Im not technically living in the GW school district I can think of some lie to stall for time, and if I have to transfer, which is the worst thing that could happen to me today, then Ill do it. If he brings up the fact that my mother is a stripper? Well, Ill call him a liar and remind him that having a stripper for a mother isnt grounds for suspension or dismissal. Hows it going, Darlene? The mom-haired school secretary barely looks up from her People magazine. Take a seat, Ella. Mr. Thompson will be right with you. Yep, were on a first-name basis, me and Darlene. One month at GW High and Ive already spent way too much time in this office, thanks to my ever-growing stack of late slips. But thats what happens when you work nights and dont see the smooth side of the sheets until three a.m. every night.

1682307158	description	Claire doesn't like to talk about herself. Because of this, she asked a friend of hers to write her bio. This is what she got: Claire is caring, smart, witty, and funny as heck. Despite being a New York Times Best Selling Author of a popular contemporary romance series, Claire doesn't read many romance novels. However, when she sits down to write, those are the ones that pour from her fingers. Much to her displeasure, we like to say she's a romantic at heart. She lives in Miami with her hot husband, two adorable boys, three bulldogs, and two stray cats that she refuses to admit are hers (even though they live on her porch and she continues to feed them). When she's not writing, she's always lost in a book (the more suspenseful, the better).

1941098126	description	"The first time it happened, it seemed like an impossible miracle. Bills were piling up, adding up to more money than I could ever make. Mom's hospital bills. My baby brother's tuition. My tuition. Rent. Electricity. All of it on my shoulders. And I had just lost my job. There was no hope, no money in my account, no work to be found. And then, just when I thought all hope was lost, I found an envelope in the mail. No return address. My name on the front, my address. Inside was a check, made out to me, in the amount of ten thousand dollars. Enough to pay the bills and leave me some left over to live on until I found a job. Enough to let me focus on classes. There was no name on the check, just ""VRI Inc.,"" and a post office box address for somewhere in the city. No hint of identity or reason for the check or anything. No mention of repayment, interest, nothing...except a single word, on the notes line: ""You."" Just those three letters."

1941098126	description	The checks kept coming. The notes stopped. Ten thousand dollars, every month. A girl gets used to that, real quick. It let me pay the bills without going into debt. Let me keep my baby brother in school and Mom's hospice care paid for. How do you turn down what seems like free money, when you're desperate? You don't. I didn't.
1941098126	description	"And then, after a year, there was a knock on my door. A sleek black limousine sat on the curb in front of my house. A driver stood in front of me, and he spoke six words: ""It's time to pay your debt."""

1942835337	description	"""Dirty Filthy Rich Love was one sinful decadent treat. It was dirty, filthy, and dangerously intoxicating!!! ... This book was everything that I wanted, craved and needed. "" - Michelle, Four Chicks Flipping Pages"
1942835337	description	"""Ms. Paige always steps up her game with every single new release she grants us with. DIRTY FILTHY RICH LOVE was a seductive masterpiece!

1942835337	description	With over 1 million books sold, Laurelin Paige is the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today Bestselling Author of the Fixed Trilogy. She's a sucker for a good romance and gets giddy anytime there's kissing, much to the embarrassment of her three daughters. Her husband doesn't seem to complain, however. When she isn't reading or writing sexy stories, she's probably singing, watching Game of Thrones and the Walking Dead, or dreaming of Michael Fassbender. She's also a proud member of Mensa International though she doesn't do anything with the organization except use it as material for her bio.

1944475079	title	Mr. Romantic (The Mister Series) (Volume 2)
1944475079	description	"""Sorry folks, but you can't skip the sex in this book. If you aren't a sex person this book isn't for you, I'm sad to say, because the writing is fantastic. The way JA Huss handles this fantasy scene is outstanding. You get dual points-of-view during the whole rape fantasy, role-play scene, his emotions, her emotions. I'll tell you, my emotions were all over the place."" - Amazon Reviewer, KMRainwater""J.A. Huss doesn't do the cookie cutter romance and so she weaves another aspect to the story line which also heightens the excitement to the story of Nolan and Ivy. So with a little twist added into the plot line, Ms. Huss has perfectly treated her readers to a love story that has layers of self-discovery, chicanery, kink, and of course romance."" - Amazon Reviewer, Ms. Meesh""Ivy and Nolan together are scorching and the fantasy..oh my God.. Both POVs means that I was really there every step of the way and with them both."" ~ Amazon Reviewer, Mary""She took me on another wild ride with her second installation for the Mister series. Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, the rollercoaster begins its slow ride and then takes you in on a deep plunge."" - Amazon Reviewer, Funkycez""The scenes and banter between these 2 are so fueled with fire, lust, hate, truth and complete trust that it turned me all inside out. From the scenes being played out in their heads, to what comes out of their mouths, I didn't know what to expect next."" - Amazon Reviewer, AlohaD""Two books in and I already CANNOT wait for the rest of the series. JA really can write a scene that peaks your curiosity. Rather it's a plot twist (because if you've every read a Huss book, you know she has those) or a scene such as the drawing, yellow dress, and rope. She sucks you into a world that blows your mind and has you begging for more. And that's exactly what I want now......more Misters. Bring on Mr. Corporate!"" - Amazon Reviewer, Jennifer""This was emotionally intense, raw, thought provoking, I was on the edge of my seat reading, literally. I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next, and was happily awed at times, and totally shocked at several of the twists, until the twists made total sense."" - Amazon Reviewer, TJ"
1944475079	description	Yeah, I went there. So fucking what. I like my fantasy rooted in reality and I happen to think there's a damn good message in here that's worth writing about. Some people want to hear it. Some people don't. Isn't freedom great? JA Huss
194447515X	title	Taking Turns (The Turning Series) (Volume 1)
194447515X	description	"""#OMG 5 star twisty bendy, hot read...where you are glued to the book as your heart races because you can't wait to see what comes next and where the story leads!"" - Goodreads Reviewer - Denise - Shh Mom's Reading""This book has been the best I have read by this author, I can not tell you how much I loved it, loved the all consuming deep connection I had with each and every character this book focused on. And like others that have read this book I too can not wait for the next book of this series, this was an epic way to start it off."" Goodreads Reviewer - Kitty Kat's Crazy About Books ""Raw, vulnerable, emotions poured out of those scenes in such a subtle way. Huss gave you the obscene but ensured that it felt intimate. You were a voyeur into their deepest sexual fantasies and you kept your eyes glued to the scene, holding your breath, fearful that even a blink would cause you to miss a moment of it."" - Goodreads Reviewer - Michelle New""Taking Turns wasn't at all what I expected. It was so much more. How J.A. Huss is able to write such an erotic, steamy, pantie wetting tale is beyond me. I couldn't get enough. I had to know how the game was going to end and if there really was going to be a winner. Taking Turns is a definite page turner."" - Goodreads Reviewer SM Harshell""The characters are complex and well thought out and unapologetically flawed. They will draw you completely into the story and once they have you, they'll never let you go. I was hooked from the first page and remained riveted to the very last word."" - Goodreads Reviewer - Jammie Bebout""It's a pretty intense read and masterfully told as always by J.A. Huss. She not only writes a romance, she writes the gritty that we tend to gloss over, the dark that we don't want to admit we have, and then tosses in something that is happening EVERY DAY in the world to give you a little reality check. I cannot wait for book two."" - Goodreads Reviewer - a_tiffyfit""I.literally.can't.even. I just read the BEST book!!!! I was so excited about this book and it did not disappoint. The story was dirty, hot, sexy, twisted and dark. It was more then I could have asked for."" - Goodreads Reviewer - Lauren Lascola-Lesczynski"
